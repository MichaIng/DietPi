// Sample Configuration File for Shairport Sync
// Commented out settings are generally the defaults, except where noted.
// See the individual sections for details.

// General Settings
general =
{
//	name = "%H"; // This means "Hostname" -- see below. This is the name the service will advertise to iTunes.
//		The default is "Hostname" -- i.e. the machine's hostname with the first letter capitalised (ASCII only.)
//		You can use the following substitutions:
//				%h for the hostname,
//				%H for the Hostname (i.e. with first letter capitalised (ASCII only)),
//				%v for the version number, e.g. 3.0 and
//				%V for the full version string, e.g. 3.3-OpenSSL-Avahi-ALSA-soxr-metadata-sysconfdir:/etc
//		Overall length can not exceed 50 characters. Example: "Shairport Sync %v on %H".
//
//	password = "secret"; // leave this commented out if you don't want to require a password
//	About the "service_type" setting below: On an AirPlay-2-capable Shairport Sync, if you wish to offer only the older "classic" AirPlay (sometimes called AirPlay 1), set service_type to "classic".
//	A potential use of this would be for Apple Music on Windows, which is not compatible with the AirPlay 2 service offered by Shairport Sync, but which is compatible with the classic service.
//	The default is "auto", which means that the AirPlay 2 service will be provided if NQPTP is present and "classic" AirPlay will be provided otherwise, with "(Classic)" appended to the service name (see above).
//	service_type = "auto"; // This can be "auto", "airplay2" or "classic".
//	The interpolation setting below controls how Shairport Sync adds or removes frames of audio to keep in sync.
//			"auto" (default) measures the processor's floating point speed and chooses "soxr" if available and it is fast enough. Otherwise, "vernier" is selected.
//			"soxr" uses the SoX library to recode a packet of frames to a new packet containing more or fewer frames. This needs a processor with fast floating point capability.
//			"vernier" recodes a packet of frames to a new packet containing more or fewer frames. This is recommended for low powered devices.
//			"basic" causes the simple removal or insertion of frames in a packet of frames. Not recommended.
//	interpolation = "auto"; // aka "stuffing". Default is "auto". Alternatives are "vernier", "basic" or "soxr". Choose "soxr" only if you have a reasonably fast processor and Shairport Sync has been built with "soxr" support.
//	output_backend = "alsa"; // Run "shairport-sync -h" to get a list of all output_backends, e.g. "alsa", "pipe", "stdout". The default is the first one.
//	mdns_backend = "avahi"; // Run "shairport-sync -h" to get a list of all mdns_backends. The default is the first one.
//	interface = "name"; // Use this advanced setting to specify the interface on which Shairport Sync should provide its service. Leave it commented out to get the default, which is to select the interface(s) automatically.
//	port = <number>; // Listen for service requests on this port. 5000 for AirPlay 1, 7000 for AirPlay 2
//	udp_port_base = 6001; // (AirPlay 1 only) start allocating UDP ports from this port number when needed
//	udp_port_range = 10; // (AirPlay 1 only) look for free ports in this number of places, starting at the UDP port base. Allow at least 10, though only three are needed in a steady state.
//	airplay_device_id_offset = 0; // (AirPlay 2 only) add this to the default airplay_device_id calculated from one of the device's MAC address
//	airplay_device_id = 0x<six-digit_hexadecimal_number>L; // (AirPlay 2 only) use this as the airplay_device_id e.g. 0xDCA632D4E8F3L -- remember the "L" at the end as it's a 64-bit quantity!
//	regtype = "<string>"; // Use this advanced setting to set the service type and transport to be advertised by Zeroconf/Bonjour. Default is "_raop._tcp" for AirPlay 1, "_airplay._tcp" for AirPlay 2.
//	drift_tolerance_in_seconds = 0.002; // allow a timing error of this number of seconds of drift away from exact synchronisation before attempting to correct it
//	resync_threshold_in_seconds = 0.050; // a synchronisation error greater than this number of seconds will cause resynchronisation; 0 disables it
//	playback_mode = "stereo"; // This can be "stereo", "mono", "reverse stereo", "both left" or "both right". Default is "stereo".
//	For FFmpeg channel and layout names, (e.g. "7.1", "FL", "3.0(back)", etc.), please see channel_names and channel_layout_map at https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/channel__layout_8c_source.html
//	eight_channel_mode = "on"; // Enable reception of eight channel audio. Can be "off", "on" or an eight-channel FFmpeg channel layout. If "on", the channel layout used is: "7.1".
//	six_channel_mode = "on"; // Enable reception of six channel audio. Can be "off", "on" or a six-channel FFmpeg channel layout. If "on", the channel layout used is: "5.1".
//	mixdown = "auto"; // Enable mixdown. Can be "auto", "off" or an FFmpeg channel layout, e.g. "quad". If "auto", mixdown will occur, if needed, to the default channel layout for the output channels available.
//	output_channel_mapping = "auto"; // Specify how audio channels are mapped to the output device's channels:
//	  Shairport Sync uses standard FFmpeg channel names for each channel in the audio output. The names are, in order, "FL", "FR", "FC", "LFE", "BL", "BR", "SL", "SR".
//	  If "auto", the audio channels are matched, where possible, to the channels in the device's channel map. Any leftover output channels are mapped, in order, to leftover device channels.
//	  If "off", or if there is no device channel map, audio channels are output to the device channels in order.
//	  If a list of audio channels is given, e.g. ( "FL", "FR", "LFE", "FC", "BL", "BR", "SL", "SR" ), they are  mapped in the order given to the device channels from 1 upwards.
//	  The audio channel list can include the same channel more than once and can include the silent channel "--".

//	volume_range_db = 60 ; // use this advanced setting to set the range, in dB, you want between the maximum volume and the minimum volume. Range is 30 to 150 dB. Leave it commented out to use mixer's native range.
//	volume_max_db = 0.0 ; // use this advanced setting, which must have a decimal point in it, to set the maximum volume, in dB, you wish to use.
//		The setting is for the hardware mixer, if chosen, or the software mixer otherwise. The value must be in the mixer's range (0.0 to -96.2 for the software mixer).
//		Leave it commented out to use mixer's maximum volume.
//	volume_control_profile = "standard" ; // use this advanced setting to specify how the airplay volume is transferred to the mixer volume.
//		"standard" makes the volume change more quickly at lower volumes and slower at higher volumes.
//		"flat" makes the volume change at the same rate at all volumes.
//		"dasl_tapered" is similar to "standard" - it makes the volume change more quickly at lower volumes and slower at higher volumes.
//			The basic idea behind dasl_tapered is that a given percentage change in volume should result in the same percentage change in
//			perceived loudness. For instance, doubling the volume level should result in doubling the perceived loudness.
//			With the range of AirPlay volume being from -30 to 0, doubling the volume from -22.5 to -15 results in an increase of 10 dB.
//			Similarly, doubling the volume from -15 to 0 results in an increase of 10 dB.
//			For compatibility with mixers having a restricted attenuation range (e.g. 30 dB), "dasl_tapered" will switch to a flat profile at low AirPlay volumes.
//	volume_control_combined_hardware_priority = "no"; // when extending the volume range by combining the built-in software attenuator with the hardware mixer attenuator, set this to "yes" to reduce volume by using the hardware mixer first, then the built-in software attenuator.

//		The desired AirPlay volume is appended to the end of the command line – leave a space if you want it treated as an extra argument.

//	audio_backend_latency_offset_in_seconds = 0.0; // This is added to the latency requested by the player to delay or advance the output by a fixed amount.
//		Use it, for example, to compensate for a fixed delay in the audio back end.
//		E.g. if the output device, e.g. a soundbar, takes 100 ms to process audio, set this to -0.1 to deliver the audio
//		to the output device 100 ms early, allowing it time to process the audio and output it perfectly in sync.
//	audio_backend_buffer_desired_length_in_seconds = 0.2; // This is the desired size of the buffer to be maintained in the external output system, e.g. the DAC in ALSA. If set too small, buffer underflow occurs on low-powered machines.
//		Too long and the response time to volume changes becomes annoying.

// Back End Settings

// Rates, Formats and Channels
// Shairport Sync can handle a wide range of output rates, formats and channels, including 48,000 and 44,100 frames per second, 32- and 24-bit sample sizes, 1 to 8 channels.
//     Possible output rates are: 5512, 8000, 11025, 16000, 22050, 32000, 44100, 48000, 64000, 88200, 96000, 176400, 192000, 352800 and 384000 frames per seconds.
//     Possible output formats are:   "S8", "U8", "S16_LE", "S16_BE", "S24_LE", "S24_BE", "S24_3LE", "S24_3BE", "S32_LE" and "S32_BE".
//     Possible output channel counts are: 1 to 8.

// Automatic settings
//     Shairport Sync will dynamically select output formats, attempting to match input and output rates, formats and channel counts, picking the best alternatives otherwise.
//     (Settings are static by default on the STDOUT and pipe backends, as there is no obvious way to signal a downstream consumer of the data when the format has changed.)

// Rate Selection:
//     Shairport Sync checks the rates the output system can accept and those that have been specified in the configuration file.
//     From that set of possibilities, Shairport Sync will attempt to match the rate at which the audio is being received and will switch the output to that rate if necessary.
//     If the exact rate is not available, an exact multiple will be selected if available. Finally, a higher rate or a lower rate will be chosen.
//     To avoid output rate switching, specify just one rate in the configuration file.

// Format Selection:
//     Shairport Sync checks the formats the output system can accept and those that have been specified in the configuration file.
//     From that set of possibilities, Shairport Sync will use the deepest format unless ignore_volume_control is true and maximum_volume is not used, if which case it will try to switch the output to the exact format of the incoming audio.
//     To avoid output format switching, specify just one format in the configuration file.

// Channel Count Selection:
//     Shairport Sync checks the channels counts the output system can accept and those that have been specified in the configuration file.
//     From that set of possibilities, Shairport Sync will attempt to match the output channels to the number of channels in the audio and will switch the output to that number of channels if necessary.
//     If the exact number of output channels is not available, a greater output channel count will be selected if available. Failing that, a lower channel count will be chosen.
//     To avoid channel count switching, specify just one channel count in the configuration file.
