## Configuration file for CAVA. Default values are commented out. Use either ';' or '#' for commenting.


[general]

# Smoothing mode. Can be 'normal', 'scientific' or 'waves'. DEPRECATED as of 0.6.0
; mode = normal
 
# Accepts only non-negative values.
; framerate = 60

# 'autosens' will attempt to decrease sensitivity if the bars peak. 1 = on, 0 = off
# new as of 0.6.0 autosens of low values (dynamic range)
# 'overshoot' allows bars to overshoot (in % of terminal height) without initiating autosens. DEPRECATED as of 0.6.0
; autosens = 1
; overshoot = 20

# Manual sensitivity in %. Autosens must be turned off for this to take effect.
# 200 means double height. Accepts only non-negative values.
; sensitivity = 100

# The number of bars (0-200). 0 sets it to auto (fill up console).
# Bars' width and space between bars in number of characters.
; bars = 0
; bar_width = 2
; bar_spacing = 1


# Lower and higher cutoff frequencies for lowest and highest bars
# the bandwidth of the visualizer.
# Note: there is a minimum total bandwidth of 43Mhz x number of bars.
# Cava will automatically increase the higher cutoff if a too low band is specified.
; lower_cutoff_freq = 50
; higher_cutoff_freq = 10000



[input]

# Audio capturing method. Possible methods are: 'pulse', 'alsa' or 'fifo'.
# Defaults to 'pulse', 'alsa' or 'fifo', in that order, dependent on what support cava was built with.
#
# All input methods uses the same config variable 'source'
# to define where it should get the audio.
#
# For pulseaudio 'source' will be the source. Default: 'auto', which uses the monitor source of the default sink
# (all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them).
# 
# For alsa 'source' will be the capture device.
# For fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file.
; method = pulse
; source = auto

; method = alsa
; source = hw:Loopback,1

method = fifo
source = /tmp/mpd.fifo



[output]

# Ouput method. Can be 'ncurses', 'noncurses' or 'raw'. 
# 'noncurses' is for systems that does not suport ncurses.
# 'raw' is a 16 bit data stream of the bar heights that can be used to send to other applications.
# 'raw' defaults to 200 bars, which can be adjusted in the 'bars' option above.
; method = ncurses

# Visual channels. Can be 'stereo' or 'mono'.
# 'stereo' mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# 'mono' averages both channels and outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies.
; channels = stereo

# Raw output target. A fifo will be created if target does not exist.
; raw_target = /dev/stdout

# Raw data format. Can be 'binary' or 'ascii'.
; data_format = binary

# Binary bit format, can be '8bit' (0-255) or '16bit' (0-65530).
; bit_format = 16bit

# Ascii max value. In 'ascii' mode range will run from 0 to value specified here
; ascii_max_range = 1000

# Ascii delimiters. In ascii format each bar and frame is separated by a delimiters.
# Use decimal value in ascii table (i.e. 59 = ';' and 10 = '\n' (line feed)).
; bar_delimiter = 59
; frame_delimiter = 10



[color]

# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.
# Or defined by hex code '#xxxxxx' (hex code must be within ''). User defined colors requires a
# terminal that can change color definitions such as Gnome-terminal or rxvt.
; background = black
; foreground = cyan

# Gradient mode, only hex defined colors are supported, background must also be defined in hex
# or remain commented out. 1 = on, 0 = off. Warning: for certain terminal emulators cava will
# not able to restore color definitions on exit, simply restart your terminal to restore colors.
; gradient = 0
; gradient_color_1 = '#0099ff'
; gradient_color_2 = '#ff3399'



[smoothing]

# Percentage value for integral smoothing. Takes values from 0 - 100.
# Higher values means smoother, but less precise. 0 to disable.
; integral = 70

# Disables or enables the so-called "Monstercat smoothing" with or without "waves". Set to 0 to disable. 
; monstercat = 1
; waves = 0;

# Set gravity percentage for "drop off". Higher values means bars will drop faster.
# Accepts only non-negative values. 50 means half gravity, 200 means double. Set to 0 to disable "drop off".
; gravity = 100


# In bar height, bars that would have been lower that this will not be drawn.
; ignore = 0


[eq]

# This one is tricky. You can have as much keys as you want.
# Remember to uncomment more then one key! More keys = more precision.
# Look at readme.md on github for further explanations and examples.
; 1 = 1 # bass
; 2 = 1
; 3 = 1 # midtone
; 4 = 1
; 5 = 1 # treble
