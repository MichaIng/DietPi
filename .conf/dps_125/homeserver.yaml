#
# Synapse automatically adds the fingerprint of its own certificate
# to the list. So if federation traffic is handled directly by synapse
# then no modification to the list is required.

# If synapse is run behind a load balancer that handles the TLS then it
# will be necessary to add the fingerprints of the certificates used by
# the loadbalancers to this list if they are different to the one
# synapse is using.
#
# Homeservers are permitted to cache the list of TLS fingerprints
# returned in the key responses up to the "valid_until_ts" returned in
# key. It may be necessary to publish the fingerprints of a new
# certificate and wait until the "valid_until_ts" of the previous key
# responses have passed before deploying it.
#
# You can calculate a fingerprint from a given TLS listener via:
# openssl s_client -connect $host:$port < /dev/null 2> /dev/null |
#   openssl x509 -outform DER | openssl sha256 -binary | base64 | tr -d '='

## Server ##

# When running as a daemon, the file to store the pid in
pid_file: "/var/run/matrix-synapse.pid"

# CPU affinity mask. Setting this restricts the CPUs on which the
# process will be scheduled. It is represented as a bitmask, with the
# lowest order bit corresponding to the first logical CPU and the
# highest order bit corresponding to the last logical CPU. Not all CPUs
# may exist on a given system but a mask may specify more CPUs than are
# present.
#
# For example:
#    0x00000001  is processor #0,
#    0x00000003  is processors #0 and #1,
#    0xFFFFFFFF  is all processors (#0 through #31).
#
# Pinning a Python process to a single CPU is desirable, because Python
# is inherently single-threaded due to the GIL, and can suffer a
# 30-40% slowdown due to cache blow-out and thread context switching
# if the scheduler happens to schedule the underlying threads across
# different cores. See

## Ratelimiting ##

# Ratelimiting settings for client actions (registration, login, messaging).
#
# Each ratelimiting configuration is made of two parameters:
#   - per_second: number of requests a client can send per second.
#   - burst_count: number of requests a client can send before being throttled.
#
# Synapse currently uses the following configurations:
#   - one for messages that ratelimits sending based on the account the client
#     is using
#   - one for registration that ratelimits registration requests based on the
#     client's IP address.
#   - one for login that ratelimits login requests based on the client's IP
#     address.
#   - one for login that ratelimits login requests based on the account the
#     client is attempting to log into.
#   - one for login that ratelimits login requests based on the account the
#     client is attempting to log into, based on the amount of failed login
#     attempts for this account.
#   - one for ratelimiting redactions by room admins. If this is not explicitly
#     set then it uses the same ratelimiting as per rc_message. This is useful
#     to allow room admins to deal with abuse quickly.
#
# The defaults are as shown below.
#
#rc_message:
#  per_second: 0.2
#  burst_count: 10
#
#rc_registration:
#  per_second: 0.17
#  burst_count: 3

# Ratelimiting settings for incoming federation
#
# The rc_federation configuration is made up of the following settings:
#   - window_size: window size in milliseconds
#   - sleep_limit: number of federation requests from a single server in
#     a window before the server will delay processing the request.
#   - sleep_delay: duration in milliseconds to delay processing events
#     from remote servers by if they go over the sleep limit.
#   - reject_limit: maximum number of concurrent federation requests
#     allowed from a single server
#   - concurrent: number of federation requests to concurrently process
#     from a single server
#
# The defaults are as shown below.
#
#rc_federation:
#  window_size: 1000
#  sleep_limit: 10
#  sleep_delay: 500
#  reject_limit: 50

url_preview_enabled: False

# List of IP address CIDR ranges that the URL preview spider is denied

# entry that points to a private IP address and circumvent the blacklist.
# This is more useful if you know there is an entire shape of URL that
# you know that will never want synapse to try to spider.
#
# Each list entry is a dictionary of url component attributes as returned
# by urlparse.urlsplit as applied to the absolute form of the URL.  See
# https://docs.python.org/2/library/urlparse.html#urlparse.urlsplit
# The values of the dictionary are treated as an filename match pattern

#
# Note: This option is deprecated. Since v0.99.4, Synapse has tracked which identity
# server a 3PID has been bound to. For 3PIDs bound before then, Synapse runs a
# background migration script, informing itself that the identity server all of its
# 3PIDs have been bound to is likely one of the below.
#
# As of Synapse v1.4.0, all other functionality of this option has been deprecated, and
# it is now solely used for the purposes of the background migration script, and can be
# removed once it has run.

# Handle threepid (email/phone etc) registration and password resets through a set of
# *trusted* identity servers. Note that this allows the configured identity server to
# reset passwords for accounts!
#
# Be aware that if `email` is not set, and SMTP options have not been
# configured in the email config block, registration and user password resets via
# email will be globally disabled.
#
# Additionally, if `msisdn` is not set, registration and password resets via msisdn
# will be disabled regardless. This is due to Synapse currently not supporting any
# method of sending SMS messages on its own.
#
# To enable using an identity server for operations regarding a particular third-party
# identifier type, set the value to the URL of that identity server as shown in the
# examples below.

#    # Millisecond POSIX timestamp when the key expired.
#    expired_ts: 123456789123

# How long key response published by this server is valid for.
# Used to set the valid_until_ts in /key/v2 APIs.
# Determines how quickly servers will query to check which keys
# are still valid.
key_refresh_interval: "1d" # 1 Day.

# The trusted servers to download signing keys from.
#
# When we need to fetch a signing key, each server is tried in parallel.
#
# Normally, the connection to the key server is validated via TLS certificates.
# Additional security can be provided by configuring a `verify key`, which
# will make synapse check that the response is signed by that key.
#
# This setting supercedes an older setting named `perspectives`. The old format
# is still supported for backwards-compatibility, but it is deprecated.
#
# 'trusted_key_servers' defaults to matrix.org, but using it will generate a
# warning on start-up. To suppress this warning, set
# 'suppress_key_server_warning' to true.
#
# Options for each entry in the list include:
#
#    server_name: the name of the server. required.
#
#    verify_keys: an optional map from key id to base64-encoded public key.
#       If specified, we will check that the response is signed by at least
#       one of the given keys.
#
#    accept_keys_insecurely: a boolean. Normally, if `verify_keys` is unset,
#       and federation_verify_certificates is not `true`, synapse will refuse
#       to start, because this would allow anyone who can spoof DNS responses
#       to masquerade as the trusted key server. If you know what you are doing
#       and are sure that your network environment provides a secure connection
#       to the key server, you can set this to `true` to override this
#       behaviour.
#
# An example configuration might look like:
#
#trusted_key_servers:
#  - server_name: "my_trusted_server.example.com"
#    verify_keys:
#      "ed25519:auto": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmopqr"
#  - server_name: "my_other_trusted_server.example.com"
#

## Single sign-on integration ##

# Enable SAML2 for registration and login. Uses pysaml2.
#
# At least one of `sp_config` or `config_path` must be set in this section to
# enable SAML login.
#
# (You will probably also want to set the following options to `false` to
# disable the regular login/registration flows:
#   * enable_registration
#   * password_config.enabled
#
# Once SAML support is enabled, a metadata file will be exposed at
# https://<server>:<port>/_matrix/saml2/metadata.xml, which you may be able to
# use to configure your SAML IdP with. Alternatively, you can manually configure
# the IdP to use an ACS location of
# https://<server>:<port>/_matrix/saml2/authn_response.
#
saml2_config:
  # `sp_config` is the configuration for the pysaml2 Service Provider.
  # See pysaml2 docs for format of config.
  #
  # Default values will be used for the 'entityid' and 'service' settings,
  # so it is not normally necessary to specify them unless you need to
  # override them.
  #
  #sp_config:
  #  # point this to the IdP's metadata. You can use either a local file or
  #  # (preferably) a URL.
  #  metadata:
  #    #local: ["saml2/idp.xml"]
  #    remote:
  #      - url: https://our_idp/metadata.xml
  #
  #    # By default, the user has to go to our login page first. If you'd like
  #    # to allow IdP-initiated login, set 'allow_unsolicited: true' in a
  #    # 'service.sp' section:
  #    #
  #    #service:
  #    #  sp:
  #    #    allow_unsolicited: true
  #
  #    # The examples below are just used to generate our metadata xml, and you
  #    # may well not need them, depending on your setup. Alternatively you
  #    # may need a whole lot more detail - see the pysaml2 docs!
