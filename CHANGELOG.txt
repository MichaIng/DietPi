v9.18
(2025-10-18)

New software:
- LazyLibrarian | This ebook and audiobook collection manager has been added to our software catalogue. It can server as a replacement for Readarr, which is not developed anymore. Many thanks to @JappeHallunken for implementing this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7747

Enhancements:
- DietPi-Drive_Manager/DietPi-FS_partition_resize | Support for Xen virtual block devices has been added, which follow the scheme /dev/xvd[a-z][1-9]. Many thanks to @jr551 for implementing this compatibility enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7755

Bug fixes:
- DietPi-AutoStart | Fixed a typo which prevents KMS/DRM from being enabled on Raspberry Pi Trixie systems if a LightDM-based autostart option is selected: LightDM login mask or automatic desktop login as non-root user. Many thanks to @TheRaven500 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7644#issuecomment-3329753442
- DietPi-Software | GMediaRender: Resolved an issue on Debian Trixie and Forky images where the package from Debian was installed instead of our own, since there was an upstream release we missed, which changed the version string only. Many thanks to @eevan78 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7767

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/ADDME

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v9.17
(2025-09-20)

Enhancements:
- Images | Our images are now shipped without ext3/ext4 journal, and instead the dietpi-fs_partition_resize script creates it after the root filesystem has been expanded. This allows smaller images, but more importantly a properly located and sized journal, depending on the final root filesystem size and layout, potentially enhancing performance. Since the journal can often only be added if the filesystem expansion was successful, and is a critical element for data crash resilience on ext3/ext4, it is now checked on first login whether it exists, else a prompt is shown, to make aware and fix the underlying issue, before seriously using DietPi. Please report if you see this prompt. The script overall seems to run more stable due to other structural changes, but as always, there might be points of failure we could not identify via tests yet.
- Raspberry Pi | Support for HiFiBerry sound cards in dietpi-config has been updated, to include recent models, and take into account the newly split overlays for DAC+/AMP2/AMP4 and DAC+ Pro/DAC2. If you run an older system with Linux 6.1 and migrate to the new Linux 6.12 kernel stack (with our dedicated script or dietpi-config Advanced Options), using one of these HiFiBerry sound cards, a prompt allows you to re-select the matching sound card to keep it functional. Many thanks to @Daoro for making us aware of this change: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7644#issuecomment-3299414462
- DietPi-Backup | If multiple backups are created (and kept), the rsync "--link-dest" option is now used to create files which did not change between last and current backup iteration as hard links to the last iteration. This usually leads to massively reduced effective disk usage and backup speedups, since unchanged files do not need to be copied, while every backup iteration however remains fully self-contained. Many thanks to @nicojx for making us aware of rsnapshot, which uses the same technique: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/discussions/7711
- DietPi-Software | Navidrome: Our default config now follows the upstream default, fetching album art not only from images embedded in media files, but also from common dedicated directory names and online from Last.fm as last resort. The change, however, is not applied retrospectively. If needed, remove the "CoverArtPriority" line from /mnt/dietpi_userdata/navidrome/navidrome.toml, or adjust it to your needs: https://www.navidrome.org/docs/usage/artwork/#albums. Many thanks to @ImNoExpertButOK for suggesting this enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7719
- DietPi-Software | Roon Server: A new dialogue and related dietpi.txt setting SOFTWARE_ROONSERVER_EARLYACCESS allows to select and switch between stable and early access builds. Information about the Roon Early Access Program can be found here: https://help.roonlabs.com/portal/en/kb/articles/roon-early-access-program. Many thanks to @Wade_Oram for raising this topic: https://community.roonlabs.com/t/272420
- DietPi-Software | NZBGet: Our default config does not apply the insecure and (hopefully) widely unsupported RC4-MD5 TLS cipher for news server connections anymore, and removes the setting as well on DietPi update, if it was not changed already. This enhances the security of news data transfers and solves connections throwing "Could not select cipher for TLS: error:0A0000B9:SSL routines::no cipher match" errors. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7726

Bug fixes:
- General | Resolved an issue where in case of a /boot bind mount or Btrfs subvolume, the block device path of the mount source was falsely detected, containing a "[/path]" suffix. The findmnt -v/--nofsroot option is now consequently used when querying the mount SOURCE. Many thanks to @AnonymousMonkeyNo12 for reporting a related issue when our Quartz64 kernel package attempts to flash the bootloader: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7698
- Raspberry Pi | Resolved an issue on Debian Trixie where the LightDM did not work without enabling KMS/DRM, and hence the related dietpi-autostart option, as well as desktop autologin as non-root user. It is strictly required for recent LightDM and is hence now done automatically. Many thanks to @TheRaven500 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7644#issuecomment-3221254709
- Rockchip SoCs | Resolved an issue where flashing the SPI bootloader could fail, since "dialog" was called if multiple U-Boot images were available, e.g. to select between M.2 NVMe and SATA support. These calls are now replaced with whiptail, which is pre-installed on DietPi.
- Rockchip SoCs | Resolved an issue where flashing the SPI bootloader could fail on Bullseye systems, since flashcp was called with the "-p" flag in some cases, supported only from Bookworm on. Many thanks to @Arkem for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/23426/46
- DietPi-Config | Resolved a v9.13 regression where setting CPU frequency limits was not possible. This has been solved for DietPi v9.16 as well via live patch. Many thanks to @gitlankford for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7696
- DietPi-Software | Resolved a v9.16 regression where installations failed if respective services were previously masked. Many thanks to @wiedehopf for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7712
- DietPi-Software | Portainer: Resolved a v9.16 regression where the installation could not manage the local Docker environment since the Docker socket was mounted to a wrong path. This has been solved for DietPi v9.16 as well via live patch. Many thanks to @pappv-dd for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7691
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Resolved an issue where the first start setup failed because of a missing new dependency. Many thanks to @mike1 and @Dynamic5912 for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/24135, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7731
- DietPi-Software | Icecast: Resolved an issue where using "&" or "<" as default software password resulted in a failing service start, since those characters have a special meaning in XML. They are now automatically HTML-encoded, which is treated correctly by the web UI for authentication. Many thanks to @gilou for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/24175

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7735

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v9.16
(2025-08-23)

Enhancements:
- General | The number of APT update calls within our script has been reduced: it is skipped in case the less than an hour ago, sources lists and architectures were not changed in between. This should speed up certain update and install processes, and reduce disk writes. The 1 hour however is taken somewhat arbitrary. If you ever face the issue that a package install of upgrade fails with 404, while it works after a fresh "apt update", please let us know.
- General | Our scripts and G_* functions do now internally re-execute themselves with sudo if needed, which makes e.g. "sudo dietpi-software" obsolete. This is especially helpful when using the fish shell, where "sudo dietpi-software" cannot work, since fish does not support calling shell aliases with sudo as easily as bash. It is however still possible to use sudo by yourself, of course. The internal root privileges checker, instead of exiting the script, runs "exec sudo <script> <arguments>...", replacing the parent script instance with the sudo wrapped call. It works as well for our G_* functions, like G_AGUG for non-interactive error-handled APT upgrades. Since sudo cannot run functions from the parent shell, we have another function which handles this, so "G_SUDO G_AGUG" was needed. This is now internally handled as well, so G_AGUG can be called directly from an unprivileged but sudo-capable user. In any case, of course, the calling user must be able to use sudo, with or without entering its password. In non-interactive shells, or when G_INTERACTIVE=0 has been set, sudo will be called with "-n" argument, which aborts the call with error, to avoid hanging processes.
- dietpi-globals | G_CHECK_ROOT_USER: Related to above change, just in case anyone uses this function in own scripts: The previous CLI arguments have been removed, instead scripts can pass their positional arguments "$@" to this function, for automatic re-execution with sudo to work properly. Set G_INTERACTIVE=0 to avoid interactive sudo password inputs if you want to assure the script does not hang at this point. This is internally set if the shell's STDIN is no terminal, like systemd services, cron jobs etc, but better be safe than sorry. If G_CHECK_ROOT_USER is called from within a function as part of an interactive shell session, previously the shell itself was exited if the check failed, unless "G_CHECK_ROOT_USER 1" was called. This argument does not exist anymore, but the function detects an interactive parent shell and only terminates the command sequence in that case, like "G_CHECK_ROOT_USER 1" did before. The automatic G_SUDO call works only if the invoking function is one of our G_* functions, else it is not attempted. More details: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7686
- Raspberry Pi | The primary UART adapter is now enabled on first boot. It was unintentionally disabled on our Raspberry Pi images.
- ROCK Pi S | Device tree overlays have been added to switch the USB-C port to host or OTG mode. By default it is in peripheral mode. Many thanks to @starsoccer for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6611
- RISC-V | The Docker Compose, Snapcast, and Amiberry dietpi-software options are now available on RISC-V systems.
- Debian Forky | We added initial support to the new Debian 14 Forky testing version and next release expected for summer 2027. This means it is detected correctly by our scripts, included in our automated testing, images are generated and hosted at https://dietpi.com/downloads/images/. But note that due to regular changes on Debian testing, software installation options are expected to break regularly, and are tested much less frequently. Use it if you like to stay on edge, and are fine to tinker more frequently after APT package upgrades.
- DietPi-Software | Domoticz: This software option has been enabled for all Debian versions and architectures. We build and distribute own packages via our own APT server for this purpose. All files in /mnt/dietpi_userdata/domoticz are treated as "conffiles", hence manual changes will never be overwritten by package upgrades. For fresh installs, however, the plain HTTP listener at port 8124 has been disabled, hence by default, access is possible via HTTPS on port 8424 only. A sudoers config has been added to make the system shutdown and restart options from the web UI work.
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: On Raspberry Pi Bookworm systems, Kodi 21 is now installed, provided as separate package from the RPi APT repository. If you want to upgrade your previously installed instance: sudo dietpi-software reinstall 31
- DietPi-Software | Kubo: The IPFS Node install option has been renamed to "Kubo". It has been renamed upstream a while ago: https://github.com/ipfs/helia/wiki/FAQ
- DietPi-Software | Java: Our implementation switched for 64-bit systems from Debian's OpenJDK packages to Adoptium's Temurin Java packages. This allows us and DietPi users to install any released Java version on any Debian version. Previously on older Debian version, some Java applications could not be used anymore, or only older versions. For now, Java 21 will be installed by dietpi-software, which is the latest LTS version. But users can add any other version via APT: https://packages.adoptium.net/ui/native/deb/pool/main/t/. However, the Adoptium repository does not support the 32-bit architecture anymore, hence those system will remain with Debian's OpenJDK packages and the related restrictions.
- DietPi-Software | Java: The Raspberry Pi repository maintainers went through the efforts to provide ARMv6-compatible Java 17 packages. Thanks to this fact, we can re-enable the Java installation options for RPi 1/Zero models, however with the limitations Java 17 has compared to Java 21, at time of writing: Minecraft max v1.20.4 and openHAB max v4.
- DietPi-Software | PaperMC: On 64-bit Debian Bullseye and Bookworm systems, PaperMC can be updated again to its latest version, using Adoptium Temurin Java 21. Previously, due to minimum Java requirements, PaperMC 1.20.4 was the latest supported version on these systems.
- DietPi-Software | Nextcloud Talk/Synapse/WireGuard: It is now possible to install these software options non-interactively, e.g. via automated first boot installs: "AUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED=1" in dietpi.txt. For this, a new dietpi.txt setting "SOFTWARE_PUBLIC_DOMAIN_NAME" has been added to define the (planned) public domain name of the DietPi system, used as default for software options which require or benefit from it. For now, only these software options and dietpi-letsencrypt will make use of SOFTWARE_PUBLIC_DOMAIN_NAME for non-interactive setups, while installs from an interactive terminal will still show a dialogue to change the default.
- DietPi-Software | Synapse: In addition to SOFTWARE_PUBLIC_DOMAIN_NAME, for Synapse installations, the new "SOFTWARE_SYNAPSE_USERNAME" dietpi.txt option can be set to define the initial admin username on non-interactive installs, which defaults to "dietpi". Hence be sure to set this when using "AUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED=1" and "AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID=125".
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard: In addition to SOFTWARE_PUBLIC_DOMAIN_NAME, for WireGuard installations, the new "SOFTWARE_WIREGUARD_MODE" and "SOFTWARE_WIREGUARD_PORT" dietpi.txt options can be set to define whether WireGuard will shall be installed as server or client, and in case which UDP port it shall listen to. The defaults are server mode and port 51820.
- DietPi-Software | Portainer: Fresh installs and reinstalls will now enable HTTPS access on port 9442. Plain HTTP access via port 9002 remains possible for now, but will be probably disabled in the future. Let us know if you face any issues accessing Portainer via HTTPS, aside of the fact that you need to accept the self-signed certificate in browsers once.

Bug fixes:
- Raspberry Pi | Resolved issues due to conflicting APT packages for the Raspberry Pi OS desktop. The related packages are now prevented via APT pins on all Raspberry Pi systems, added as well with this DietPi update. This was previously done only on LXDE install, since its base packages from the RPi repo are highly customized for the RPi OS desktop. But e.g. related GTK packages with conflicting dependencies are pulled in by other desktop and GUI packages as well. Many thanks to @anijatsu and others for reporting related issues: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6959
- NanoPi 4/5/6 series | Resolved an issue where the DietPi APT repo entry could have been malformed so that kernel upgrades were missing.
- Debian Trixie | The install of Xfce and GNUstep desktops, as well as enabling Amiberry standard boot via dietpi-autostart failed, due the attempt to install the policykit-1 package, which is a dummy transitional on Bookworm and has been removed on Trixie. Instead, from Bookworm on, the successor polkitd package is installed, which provides the same features to elevate privileges for e.g. poweroff/reboot from desktop and systemctl execution. Many thanks to @0xB33r for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7650
- DietPi-BugReport | Resolved an issue where generating a bug report failed on recent images if (p)7zip was not installed. This became an issue since we stopped to pre-install it on our images. Bug reports are not compress with xz if present, else gzip. Many thanks to @0xB33r for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7650
- DietPi-Display | Resolved an issue where display with once stored settings were always shown as disabled, when starting the script again.
- DietPi-Software | VSCodium: This software options has been disabled on 32-bit ARM systems, since the project stopped distribution packages for those architectures with their APT repository.
- DietPi-Software | Koel: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on 32-bit systems from Debian Bookworm on, due to a pre-installed dependency which strictly requires 64-bit. The dependency is now downgraded on accepted systems via PHP Composer.
- DietPi-Software | Kavita: Resolved an issue where the installer tried to exit a non-existing config file, so that the daemon was not listening on port 2036 as expected, but port 5000 instead.
- DietPi-Software | Docker Compose: This software option has been enabled for the RISC-V architecture.
- DietPi-Software | Syncthing: Resolved an issue where the installation failed due to CLI changes in the latest release v2.0.0.
- DietPi-Software | Raspotify: Resolved an issue where Raspotify could cause and endless failure loop on shutdown, effectively preventing the shutdown procedure from ever finishing.
- DietPi-Software | openHAB: Resolved an issue where the latest package could not run anymore on Debian Bullseye and Bookworm systems, since the minimum Java version requirement raised to Java 21 with openHAB 5. This is now possible on 64-bit systems, as we moved to Adoptium Temurin Java packages. On 32-bit Bullseye and Bookworm systems, the latest openHAB 4 will be installed instead, and the DietPi update performs a downgrade if needed. Many thanks to @MDAR for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7657
- DietPi-Software | Nukkit: Resolved an issue where a reinstall/update overwrote the config file. It is now never overwritten if present.
- DietPi-Software | Node.js: Resolved an issue where the installed Node.js on ARMv6 Bullseye systems was not functional, since it required a newer C++ ABI version than provided by Raspbian Bullseye.
- DietPi-Software | ADS-B Feeder: Resolved an issue on non-usr-merged Bullseye systems where the service startup failed due to explicit /usr/bin/bash usage.
- DietPi-Software | MicroK8s: Resolved an issue where the installation could have failed on Debian Bullseye and Bookworm, due to too old snapd. snapd is updated with its own snap in the process anyway, so we do this now before installing the actual MicroK8s snap, just changing the order of things to fix it.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7678

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v9.15
(2025-07-28)

New images:
- Orange Pi 3 | Support for the non-LTS version of this board was added.

Enhancements:
- Debian Trixie | In preparation for the Debian Trixie release, scheduled for August 9th (https://release.debian.org/), we further polished compatibility, and created a script for a seamless distro upgrade from Bookworm to Trixie, similar to the script which allows upgrades from Debian Bullseye to Bookworm. All info can be found here: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7644
- NanoPi R5C | Its onboard Ethernet adapters are now assigned static MAC addresses as well, like done earlier for the other NanoPi mini routers last DietPi release.
- DietPi-Display | Kernel command-line config detection has been widened to support more setups: GRUB is supported independent of the architecture, and settings are now changed in all found (and supported) config files, instead of just in the first. Many thanks to @adshrc for pointing out the too limited support for GRUB: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7390#issuecomment-3012510974
- DietPi-Display | The tool does now always show those settings previously applied, and reads the sysfs API only for settings which were not explicitly saved earlier. Previously, to faster detect non-functional settings and inconsistencies, even if settings were previously stored to the kernel command-line, the tool always read all values for enabled and connected displays from the sysfs API. This however means that when applying settings, exiting and restarting the tool, the previously applied settings are not shown anymore, and more importantly, all shown possibly different values were applied when changing only one setting. In the meantime, we know about inconsistencies when managing multiple displays, that e.g. on Raspberry Pi the rotation applied to one display, applies to all onboard display ports, and that the list of nodes from the sysfs API is neither consistently sorted, nor complete, entries can miss parameters, leading to duplicates, and on Raspberry Pi all modes with resolutions above the current one are simply missing. It makes more sense to consequently show those settings explicitly applied, and it can be seen on the display(s) whether/in how far they work or not. Many thanks to @adshrc again for the follow-up report.
- DietPi-Software | Moonlight (GUI): The game streaming client has been unlocked for all ARM and RISC-V systems, excluding only ARMv6 RPi models. Functionality may however depend on whether KMS and V4L2 drivers are available, and how well they work.
- DietPi-Software | Unbound: In favour of Unbound builtin data, the monthly cron job to download DNS root hints from "https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root" is removed, together with the "root-hints:" setting in our default config. DNS root servers do by far not change that regularly, and Debian defaults do not make use of dedicated root hints either. This also closes one potential attack vector introduced by the monthly download, which relied on HTTPS authenticity only.
- DietPi-Software | Unbound: We do now provide our own up-to-date Unbound package, though for now not automatically via our APT server. All details and install instructions can be found in the respective pull request, which can be also used for discussing the topic: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7632

Bug fixes:
- Debian Bullseye | Resolved an issue where APT updates failed because the bullseye-backports suite is not available on the main Debian repo anymore. It will be pulled from archive.debian.org now. Many thanks to @ILPlais for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7630
- DietPi-Dashboard | Resolved an issue where the installing the nightly version, enforced on Raspberry Pi 5 and RISC-V systems, failed if no unzip was installed. Reason was a resulting HEAD request, which is always failing with 404 on the nightly.link URL we use to store dashboard nightly builds.
- DietPi-Software | microblog.pub: Resolved an issue where the installation failed because of outdated dependencies. Since the project is not currently maintained, its Python dependencies are not updated. This is now done with Poetry within our installation code.
- DietPi-Software | Ampache: Resolved an issue where the install on Debian Bullseye systems always throw an error that the latest version could not be detected, hence the fallback URL was used. Many thanks to @jerin04 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7611
- DietPi-Software | File Browser: Resolved an issue where the installation failed if the default software password had a length below 12 characters. The minimum password length requirement for File Browser is reduced automatically, to match the default software password if needed. However, we do encourage everyone to assign a long and strong default software password. 12 characters is not an unreasonable minimum. Many thanks to @lutfor-diu for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7612
- DietPi-Software | OctoPrint: Resolved a regression where the installation failed on RISC-V systems because of false "runuser" syntax.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7638

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v9.14
(2025-06-22)

New images:
- Orange Pi 5 Ultra | Support for the latest successor of the Orange Pi 5 family has been added to DietPi. Compared to the original Orange Pi 5, it features DDR5 RAM, onboard WiFi 6E, 2.5 Gbit Ethernet, an eMMC slot, an additional HDMI input port, and supports NVMe SSDs up to 2280 format. It is very similar to the Orange Pi 5 Max, but one of its HDMI port is an input port. It is disabled by default but can be enabled via device tree overlay by setting "overlays=hdmirx" in your /boot/dietpiEnv.txt.
- Orange Pi CM5 | Support for the latest compute module from Xunlong/Orange Pi has been added to DietPi. It features an RK3588S SoC 2-16 GiB DDR4 RAM, 32-256 MiB onboard eMMC storage, other features depending on the used base board. It has been tested on the Tablet Base Board. If you have the other Base Board, please check the following discussion to check or report which features have been tested successfully: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/discussions/7574

New software:
- GZDoom | This modder-friendly OpenGL and Vulkan source port based on the DOOM engine has been added to our software catalogue. Many thanks to @Captain-Beefheart for suggestion and supporting the implementation of this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/discussions/7497

Enhancements:
- Container | sysctl cannot change values from within containers, but it needs to be done on the host instead. When dietpi-software would apply sysctl settings for certain software options, on container systems, it instead shows a dialogue with additional information, and how to apply the suggested change on the host.
- NanoPi R4S/R5S/R6S/R6C | All onboard Ethernet adapters are now assigned a static MAC address.
- NanoPi R4S/R5S | A kernel patch was added which applies the native Ethernet driver LED triggers as default for their respective LEDs. In turn we remove the udev rules for the netdev trigger, which caused boot issues in rare cases, due to the needed interface up/down hack. The downside is that the native triggers do not indicate network activity, only a cable link as static light. Many thanks to @cxgth and @yjteng for reporting a related issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6951
- Orange Pi Zero 2W | Added udev rules to enable the Ethernet LEDs of the official Orange Pi Expansion Board. Many thanks to @ZjemCiKolege for the request: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6827#issuecomment-2776741253
- SOQuartz | The recent kernel upgrade ships device trees for the Blade and Model A base boards. Previously, only the C4 base board was included. For now, the device tree needs to be adjusted manually in /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf. If you own a Blase base board, please reach out. So we can figure out a method to detect it, and apply the correct device tree automatically on first boot.
- Odroid HC4 | We created an own hardware ID and provide own images for this SBC from now on. Previously, Odroid C4 and HC4 shared the same hardware ID and bootloader. In recent versions, this caused issues with the USB ports on HC4, and it always had the issue that no SPI bootloader was shipped with the package. Many thanks to @amibumpin and others for reporting this issue and testing the fix: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/23524
- ARM SBCs | New ARM images with U-Boot /boot/boot.scr script usage will not make use of the legacy /boot/uInitrd format initramfs image anymore, but will load raw initrd images instead. This makes one step during initramfs updates obsolete, where an additional script converts the raw image generated by initramfs-tools into an uInitrd format image. However, for this to work, there are changes at multiple lines needed in the boot script, which is not trivial to safely patch during DietPi update. We might do it with a later release, but until then, if you are interested in applying the change, just reach out, and we will provide instructions.
- ARM SBCs | Similarly to above change, the /boot/boot.scr script of new images supports multiple device tree overlay prefixes. The overlays shipped with the kernel/dtb package have different by times overlapping prefixes, also depending on the kernel version/branch. Especially for RK35xx SBCs this made it unnecessarily difficult to deal with overlays. This also opens the door for implementing a fully functional device tree overlay selection menu into dietpi-config, but with a later release ;).
- ARM SBCs | Realtek WiFi drivers for Rockchip/Allwinner/Amlogic mainline Linux builds have been reviewed and aligned: Where available, the module of the mainline RTW88 driver family has been enabled and respective 3rd party drivers disabled. If you have a WiFi adapter with RTL8814AU chip, and it is not working properly after the kernel upgrade, please inform us. It is the only missing dedicated driver module on Linux 6.12, compared to before the change. But another module from the RTL88XXAU family should work as fallback. Many thanks to @kartikynwa for reporting a related problem with an unnecessarily enabled and used 3rd party driver: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7151

Bug fixes:
- Allwinner H3 | Resolved an issue where boot could fail with the new Linux 6.12 kernel on old systems. Reason is a too low memory address used to load the environment variables and device tree overlays to, overlapping with the memory region used by the raised initramfs image. Many thanks to @mhjessen for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7557
- Raspberry Pi | Resolved an issue where on older images, hardware accelerated video codecs could stay disabled, even when enabling them via dietpi-config. We split camera and codec toggles a while ago, but did not migrate the module blacklists accordingly. This is now done via DietPi update for affected systems. Many thanks to @danergo for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7491
- ROCK64 | Resolved an issue where boot could fail with Linux 6.12 if a too old U-Boot version is present on the SPI storage. In turn, our new U-Boot package contains an SPI image as well, which will be flashed on DietPi update to prevent issues with the kernel upgrade. Many thanks to @usr_9 and others for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/23426
- DietPi-Backup | Resolved an issue where white spaces and some other special characters in the backup directory path were not correctly handled, when the config file is read. If you were affected be regular resets to the default path, please set the path once more after this update, and it should stay persistent. Many thanks to @Krouwndouwn for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7439
- DietPi-Software | X11: Resolved a regression where X11 was not actually installed, but only configuration files. Many thanks to @oliverhbailey for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7560
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Resolve an issue where the service could have failed to start after a reinstall (HA update) if the Python version was updated as well, due to an obsolete config file pointing to the old Python version. Many thanks to @GrimXer0 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7525#issuecomment-2918176369
- DietPi-Software | Chromium: Resolved an issue where hardware acceleration on ARM systems was mostly disabled due to a faulty flag. Many thanks to @mjmo for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/22518
- DietPi-Software | Deluge: Resolved an issue where Deluge was not functional on Bookworm systems due to an unfixed incompatibility between the Deluge version and Python 3.11, shipped by Bookworm APT repositories. Many thanks to @shlatchz and @Arghh for reporting the issue and texting the fix: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6408

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7585

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v9.13
(2025-05-25)

Removed software:
- Google AIY | The Google AIY Voice Kit is not produced or sold anymore, and the related software repositories have been archived years ago. Furthermore we used install steps which were deprecated even years before the repository has been archived, and no sample to test whether it still works or not. If you still have an instance running, or aim to still try to get one running, here are uninstall instructions, as well as a link to the latest install instructions: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7533
- Mycroft AI | As we state on our docs since over a year, Mycroft AI has shut down: https://mailchi.mp/cccbfdd464c7/mycroft-is-winding-down-its-operations-6268807. There are two forks we might want to implement as alternative: OpenVoiceOS and Neon AI. Let us know if you are interested, and we will help with the implementation. If you have a left dysfunctional Mycroft AI instance on your DietPi system, here is how to uninstall it manually: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7534

Enhancements:
- General | DietPi will now enforce the change of the default user and software passwords for security reasons. This also applies retrospectively during DietPi update, showing a prompt, if one of the two default users or dietpi-software still use the default password. However, the password set in dietpi.txt will now be applied in any case (before it is removed from that file), also without "AUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED=1", and if it does not equal the default, no further prompt will be shown.
- General | DietPi images will now ship without unzip, 7zip and bzip2 compression tools pre-installed. Our code has been adjusted to install those automatically if needed. Let us know if you think these are manually used too often to be missing.
- Orange Pi 3B | Added support for the PWM fan connector to mainline kernel builds. Many thanks to @Vyacheslav-S for reporting this missing kernel feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7490#issuecomment-2829426560
- Radxa ZERO 3 | An upgrade to the Linux 6.1 based vendor kernel will be offered on DietPi update and implemented into new images from now on. Among other enhancements, this enables HDMI audio. Many thanks to @simpL3gr for reporting the missing HDMI audio functionality: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7520
- ASUS Tinker Board 2 | Resolved an issue where the onboard Ethernet MAC address changed each boot with the new Linux 6.12 based kernel. Many thanks to @briney83 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7522
- Virtual Machines | Our future VM images will ship with initramfs-tools instead of tiny-initramfs. The latter generates *much* smaller initramfs images (~1 MiB vs ~35 MiB), which is partly achieved by adding only those kernel modules actually used by the host. This auto-detection cannot work when generating images via container on other host systems, hence we maintained a small list of block device controller drivers known to be used by the virtualisers we provide images for. The default controller can however be changed, which then renders the image unbootable, and a static list of controller drivers reduces the compatibility of our VM images. For our Clonezilla-based installer images it causes the additional issue that Clonezilla aims to regenerate the initramfs via "update-initramfs" command, which would add possibly missing drivers, but tiny-initramfs provides "update-tirfs" instead. Furthermore, while Debian still maintains a tiny-initramfs package, there is actually no upstream development since years. We love small images with low disk I/O (for initramfs image generation), but sadly the downsides have become too large to keep using tiny-initramfs. Many thanks to @TheLinuxGuy for reporting the issue with Clonezilla, and an in turn unbootable VM image on Proxmox: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7468
- First run setup/DietPi-Config | The keyboard layout dialogue has been simplified. It shows a single list of supported layouts now, instead of the multiple steps to select keyboard model, navigate back and forth for the correct language, layout, and layout variant, and additional options like AltGr and compose key functions, presented by "dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration". If additional options are needed, it is still possible to start the extended dialogue by selecting "Advanced" in our simplified menu. Else it will select the genetic 105-key keyboard model, default layout variant and options, which will work fine for most users, including most laptop keyboards, with and without keypad. The goal is to simplify and speed up the first run setup, as well as to unify the code sections which trigger a keyboard configuration.
- DietPi-Software | Gitea: This software option has been enabled for RISC-V systems, supported since v1.23.8.

Bug fixes:
- Orange Pi 3B v1.1 | Resolved an issue where Ethernet did not work with the old revision of this board, when booting with the vendor bootloader from SPI. Many thanks to @iivailo for reporting this issue, and @Kwiboo for valuable insights based on ROCK 3B, which suffered from the same issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7490, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7327#issuecomment-2589181487
- Orange Pi Zero 3/2W | Resolved an issue where, especially on the 1 GB RAM variant, the RAM was sometimes detected with doubled size, leading to system crashes when it tries to write to these non-existing addresses. Many thanks to @bigross8 and others for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7242
- DietPi-Set_CPU | Resolved an issue where on certain rare systems, the maximum CPU scheduling frequency was set to the min possible frequency, or the other way round, if not explicitly set differently. Many thanks to @fat-pi2 and @waym for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/6560
- DietPi-Imager | Resolved an issue where the last partition of the input system was not detected correctly, when running the imager on a Debian Bullseye host, or one with comparable lsblk/util-linux version. Its size was hence not reduced as intended, leading to a huge output image. Many thanks to @DrCWO for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7527
- DietPi-Display | Resolved an issue where manually disabled displays did never show up again in the menu after a reboot, until the related kernel command-line argument is removed or adjusted manually. This is since disabled displays usually show up as "disconnected" in the sysfs API, which is then skipped by the tool. In addition to the sysfs API, kernel command-line configs are now checked for video (display) entries, and those in case shown in the tool. That way it is possible to always re-enable displays, which have been disabled with the tool.
- DietPi-Display | Resolved an issue where the extlinux config was not parsed correctly, which could lead to duplicate kernel command-line arguments, when changing settings for the same display multiple times.
- DietPi-Software | RPi.GPIO: Resolved a regression where the installation failed on Bullseye systems as the python3-rpi-lgpio compatibility package exists since Bookworm only.
- DietPi-Software | fish: Resolved a syntax error on uninstall, and assured that all users who use fish as login shell are altered to use bash instead. Many thanks to @echtfrank for reporting these issues: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7500
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Resolved an issue where latest HA could not be installed/updated due to a raised Python requirement on v3.13.2. Many thanks to @whyisthisbroken and @Yougoshatenshi for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7525
- DietPi-Software | Redis: Solved a startup warning that memory overcommit should be enabled. This is applied for fresh Redis installs as well as via DietPi update for existing instances.
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an old visual glitch in the "Browse software" menu, where cryptic characters showed up the end of some checkbox lines, worsening when scrolling up and down. The underlying reason is a 199 bytes limit for whiptail checkbox and menu lines, which splits also multi-byte characters apart, like the "box drawing" horizontal line used for category delimiter lines by some of our menus. And since those line characters are 3-bytes in size, the 199 bytes limit can be reached as well in dialogues with only 96 characters width, like our current software menu. We use now regular 1-byte size dashes in category delimiter lines, to never reach the 199 bytes limit.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7540

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v9.12
(2025-04-18)

New software:
- fish | A dietpi-software entry for this alternative shell has been added. Aside of installing the fish APT package, a DietPi-specific config script is added to enable dietpi-* aliases and load the dietpi-login script for first run setup and autostart options. Many thanks to @ndrew222 for implementing this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7452

Enhancements:
- General | DietPi scripts will now call "sensible-editor" instead of "nano" for opening text files in a command-line text editor. This makes also use of the "update-alternatives" feature, will usually prefer e.g. Vim if installed, and may allow interactive selection of one of the installed editors, if multiple are available. Many thanks to @Keating950 for implementing this enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7474
- DietPi-Backup | Support for writing a backup into an SSHFS has been added.
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Our packages have been updated to Amiberry v7. Additionally, recommended for ARM and RISC-V SBCs slower than Raspberry Pi 4, Amiberry-Lite has been implemented as dedicated software option. Since APT upgrades from Amiberry v5 to v7 automatically, a backup of the old config/data directory will be created, and in case used as initial config/data directory for Amiberry-Lite. Hence if Amiberry v7 does not run well on your platform, you can install Amiberry-Lite, starting with the previous v5 setup. Some more details about the two variants can be found here: https://github.com/BlitterStudio/amiberry/wiki/First-Installation#which-version-should-i-pick
- DietPi-Software | WiringPi: Added support for Orange Pi boards, using the wiringOP sources from Xunlong: https://github.com/orangepi-xunlong/wiringOP
- DietPi-Software | Spotifyd: Added support for ARMv8 and x86_64 Bookworm/Trixie systems, supported with the latest Spotifyd release.
- DietPi-Software | RPi.GPIO: Since the modern Raspberry Pi kernel removed support for the legacy GPIO API, python3-rpi-lgpio will now be installed instead, providing an RPi.GPIO compatibility layer for the modern lgpio library.
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: By default, instances installed via dietpi-software will additionally listen on TCP port 8489 for HTTPS requests. It is one of the Pi-hole v6 core features users might expect enabled by default. It uses a self-signed TLS certificate by default, hence browsers will show a warning until it is replaced by a TLS certificate from by a trusted public certificate authority.

Bug fixes:
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where enabling the waveshare32 LCD panel failed on Raspberry Pi with new kernel/firmware stack. Many thanks to @guiksign for fixing this bug: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7462
- DietPi-Software | O!MPD: Resolved an issue where changing the config.php from within the web UI and storing covers did not work due to missing permissions. Many thanks to @praveensg for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/22993
- DietPi-Software | FreshRSS: Resolved an issue where the website did not work properly on Bullseye systems, since FreshRSS v1.25.0 and later requires PHP 8.1+. On those systems, the latest v1.24.3 will be installed instead. Many thanks to @kaferenza for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/23129

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7480

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v9.11
(2025-02-23)

Bug fixes:
- Quartz64/Star64/VisionFive 2 | Resolves an issue where the import of config files from the setup FAT partition and root filesystem expansion on first boot could have failed. Many thanks to @disconn3ct for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6838
- DietPi-FirstBoot | Resolved an issue, where the automatic first run setup could have failed, if the network adapter, wpa_supplicant or DHCP client took a little longer to receive an IP address, without "ifup" further halting the script. In case of "AUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED=1" in dietpi.txt, the very first network check is assured to try at least 4 times, with a 5 seconds delay between each attempt.
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on Raspberry Pi where selecting the linux-image-rpi-v8 kernel on 32-bit images failed. Many thanks to @SOULV1CE for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7402
- DietPi-Software | Fail2Ban: Resolved an issue where the install failed while downloading updated Dropbear filters. Many thanks to @Stream5710 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7413
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Support for Pi-hole v6 was added. During the DietPi update, we check whether your Pi-hole has been updated already, and in case perform some migration and cleanup of DietPi-specific configs. Also, since Pi-hole v6 ships with its internal webserver and PHP interpreter, if a webserver and PHP are installed without any dependant among dietpi-software options, it is offered to uninstall them.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7426

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v9.10
(2025-02-09)

Enhancements:
- RISC-V | Debian Trixie does now support this architecture, hence our VisionFive 2 and Star64 images are now provided with Debian Trixie/testing instead of Debian Sid/unstable, and existing systems will be migrated to the Trixie suite.
- RISC-V | Additional software options have been enabled for RISC-V systems: Bazarr, Raspotify, NZBGet, MicroK8s and AdGuard Home
- NanoPi M6 | It is now possible to enable and configure the DSI display ports on this board with the new DietPi-Display tool (see below).
- Raspberry Pi | On Bookworm or above, the migration to the new Raspberry Pi kernel/firmware stack is now possible via dietpi-config > Advanced Options > RPi firmware migration, and is offered during this DietPi update: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6676
- DietPi-Display | A new DietPi script has been added to control console display modes and rotation via KMS/DRM. It as well allows to enable the KMS/DRM driver on Raspberry Pi, if this is not the case already, and enable DSI display ports on NanoPi M6. We keep adding more features and shift options from the dietpi-config display menu over to the new script. It is currently in beta phase, since there are open question and problem with the DRM sysfs interface, multi-display behaviour and similar. You can call the script from console via "dietpi-display", or find it in the dietpi-config menu. If you face any issues or have suggestions, please participate at the related GitHub issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7390
- DietPi-Services | When running "dietpi-services (re)start service_name", disabled services will be (re)started again. We changed it a way that "dietpi-services (re)start" without adding any explicit service will handle enabled services only, to not start disabled services after maintenance tasks from within DietPi scripts. When users call it with a particular service as CLI input, this is counter-intuitive. However, generally, when aiming to start/stop/restart/enable/disable individual services from console, use systemctl. Using dietpi-services for this is obsolete. Many thanks to @lupa18 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7384
- DietPi-Software | The new AUTO_SETUP_APT_INSTALLS dietpi.txt setting can now be used to have APT packages automatically installed after the first run setup of DietPi systems. See dietpi.txt for details.
- DietPi-Software | The AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID dietpi.txt settings now allows to define multiple software IDs in a single line, separated by space. For now, multiple AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID lines are still supported, but this will change in the future. If you keep a dietpi.txt for future DietPi instances, and make use of the AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID setting, please update it accordingly.
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: We enabled the software option for ARMv6 Bookworm systems, since packages for Raspbian Bookworm are now available. Many thanks to @hackslikeus for bringing up the topic: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7345
- DietPi-Software | vaultwarden: Our builds will now show the package version within the web UI. Many thanks to @gh3597 for reporting it missing and how to add it: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7364

Removed software:
- DietPi-Software | A number of software options have been removed from our menus, which were installed just as single APT package, without any configuration or dependant. Running dietpi-software for such is overkill, as one can just use the native Debian package manager directly, like "apt install tcpdump". Affected packages: vifm, iftop, iptraf, iperf, mtr-tiny, nload, tcpdump, emacs, jed, vim, vim-tiny, neovim. Note: They won't be removed from your system, and they are upgraded as usual via "apt upgrade" or DietPi updates. The only difference is that you cannot install or uninstall them via dietpi-software anymore, but instead via APT directly. The new AUTO_SETUP_APT_INSTALLS dietpi.txt allows to automate this the same way as AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID did before.

Bug fixes:
- Orange Pi 5 Max | Resolved an issue where onboard WiFi was not working. Many thanks to @diego-hsp for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7338
- DietPi-Software | Sonarr: Resolved an issue where the internal updater did not work due to permission limits in the systemd unit. Many thanks to @tellice for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7321
- DietPi-Software | Sonarr: Resolved an issue where configs were lost during Sonarr v3 => v4 migration/reinstall.
- DietPi-Software | Fail2Ban: Resolved an issue where a fixed Dropbear filter could not be installed, because the directory did not exist yet. Many thanks to @augustresende for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7325
- DietPi-Software | Raspotify: Resolved an issue where the service failed to start, if Avahi-Daemon was not installed. librespot has it as new default DNS discovery backend, and official pre-compiled Raspotify binaries are not compiled with the old DNS-SD backend anymore. Avahi-Daemon is hence installed now by DietPi-Software as well. Many thanks to @gergokis for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7323
- DietPi-Software | Navidrome: Resolved an issue where the service failed to start, since the latest release archive does not ship with the needed permissions. Many thanks to @nclro for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7336
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Worked around an issue where the installation failed on ARMv6 and RISC-V systems, due to an incompatibility between two dependencies. Many thanks to @jankkhvej for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7329
- DietPi-Software | Komga: Resolved an issue where the service start on fresh installs failed, since the latest version does not auto-generate the needed .komga sub directory anymore.
- DietPi-Software | PaperMC: Resolved an issue where the installation failed, because the API URL changed. Many thanks to @onkeld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7349
- DietPi-Software | PaperMC: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on Bullseye and Bookworm systems, as Minecraft 1.21 requires Java 21, available on Debian Trixie only. PaperMC 1.20.4 will be installed in those cases now, the latest version which supports Java 17.
- DietPi-Software | Java: Since the Java 8 package from Raspbian cannot be successfully installed anymore, due to a dependency conflict, and newer (Hotspot VM) Java versions are not compatible with ARMv6, Java and all Java applications have been disabled for this architecture (RPi 1 and Zero). You can still uninstall related applications via dietpi-software, but not install or reinstall them. We are sorry for this step, but our related bug report at Raspbian did not get any traction, and also on Raspberry Pi forum the issue did not really come up since the year it exists. Java applications on Linux anyway consume a lot of resources (for the runtime) and are slow, hence the interest running such on old RPi 1 and Zero (1) models seems to be minimal, and it had limitations due to Java 8 only. If anyone is seriously interested, please push the existing Raspbian bug report, as a fix at Raspbian side is theoretically very simple: https://bugs.launchpad.net/raspbian/+bug/2087632. If there was a 3rd party APT repository with recent ARMv6-compatible Java versions, that would be an option as well.
- DietPi-Software | Bazarr: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on Trixie systems due to missing build dependencies.
- DietPi-Software | Mono: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on Trixie systems due to conflicting dependencies of packages from the Mono repo. It is now installed from the Debian repository, which ships the latest version since Trixie.
- DietPi-Software | Gogs: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on ARMv7 systems, since the latest release v0.13.2 does not provide binaries for this architecture anymore. We provide now own builds for those, like we do for ARMv6 and RISC-V already.
- DietPi-Software | Domoticz: Resolved an issue where the installation failed, because of a changed download URL. Many thanks to @IgrekLg for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7375
- DietPi-Software | Baïkal: Resolved an issue where the installation on Bullseye systems failed, because Baïkal 0.10.0 dropped support for PHP 7.4. Version 0.9.5 is now installed on Bullseye. Many thanks to @BeardedWidget for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7387

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7392

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v9.9
(2024-12-23)

New images:
- Orange Pi 5 Pro | Support for this new variant of the Orange Pi 5 family has been added to DietPi. Compared to the original Orange Pi 5, it features onboard WiFi 5, an eMMC slot, dual HDMI, and supports NVMe SSDs up to 2280 format.
- Orange Pi 5 Max | Support for this new variant of the Orange Pi 5 family has been added to DietPi. Compared to the Orange Pi 5 Pro, it features onboard WiFi 6E and 2.5G Ethernet.
- NanoPi M6 | Support for this FriendlyELEC SBC with RK3588 SoC has been added to DietPi. Compared to the NanoPi R6S/R6C and NanoPC T6, aside of the great onboard features, we observed a significantly lower idle power usage. As usual, the optional metal case keeps it at cool temperatures, and has an LCD display builtin, which can be enabled via device tree overlay in DietPi. A related dietpi-config toggle is added with next release.

Enhancements:
- Virtual Machines | systemd-logind is now enabled by default on VMs, as it provides ACPI functionality, needed to properly shutdown or reboot the VM from the virtualiser software, usually expected by users.
- DietPi-DDNS | The "IPv6or4" option to update IPv6 only, if supported by server, network and provider, has been replaced with "IPv4and6". A server being reachable via IPv6 only is rarely wanted, as many networks do not support it. Instead, usually one will want to have it reachable via both, IPv4 as well as IPv6, which is now possible when using DietPi-DDNS, and the new default. If, e.g. for security reason, IPv6 only is wanted, this option of course remains available, like before. Many thanks to @LOGIN-TB for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7278
- DietPi-DDNS | The cron job does now log server response messages and connection errors separately with respective severities. Some DDNS providers do not return an HTTP error code, but an error text embedded into a regular HTTP 200 response. This, as well as success responses can now be seen via "journalctl -t dietpi-ddns". Many thanks to @jtmoon79 for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5954
- DietPi-Services | "dietpi-services start" will not start disabled services anymore. This aligns with the behaviour of the "restart" command, which as well skips disabled services. The script is used within other DietPi scripts to (re)start services after maintenance operations, and it is unexpected when services, who were not running before, but explicitly disabled, are running afterwards. To manually start/stop individual services from the console, we recommend using "systemctl" directly, like on any other Linux distribution with systemd. Many thanks to @intiplink for reporting this unexpected behaviour while using dietpi-drive_manager: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7302
- DietPi-Software | NFS Server: The "fsid=0" option has been removed from the /mnt/dietpi_userdata default export. As it is uncommon and not respected in "showmount -e" export lists, it caused confusion and issues.
- DietPi-Software | YaCy: The latest YaCy version will now be installed, and the global software password will be set as default admin password on fresh installs.
- DietPi-Software | MineOS: As a security enhancement and workaround for a web UI login issue, a dedicated "mineos" user is created again. For new MineOS installs or after reinstall, one can login with this user, and the global software password. It has permissions to install and manage Minecraft instances.
- DietPi-Software | frp: It is now possible to connect the client to a server which has no (an empty) authentication token configured. frp can now be installed non-interactively, where client + server daemons are both installed and configured to work with each other, with respective defaults for all inputs.
- DietPi-Software | frp: Since the ini format for config files has been deprecated, and support will be removed in a future frp release, new installs and reinstalls/updates will generated toml format config files from now on. As of the large amount of config keys, which all changed between those formats, an automated conversion is sadly not possible. When doing a reinstall with existing ini configs, you will be informed about it, the old config(s) will be kept as backup in place, for a manual migration. All config keys for the toml format can be found here: https://github.com/fatedier/frp/tree/dev/conf
- DietPi-Software | Logitech Media Server: LMS has been renamed to Lyrion Music Server. For more details, see their new official website: https://lyrion.org/reference/lyrion-music-server/
- DietPi-Software | Sonarr: Sonarr v4 will be installed from now on, and a migration to Sonarr v4 is now possible by reinstall it via "dietpi-software reinstall 144". Note that, since Sonarr v4 does not support ARMv6, this is not the case and not possible on RPi 1 and Zero (1). After a migration, one might want to uninstall Mono, which is not required for Sonarr v4 anymore. Note that some settings may be lost as of the database migration. At best create a backup, offered before the reinstall, and inform yourself about possible database migration issues and losses on the Sonarr websites.

Bug fixes:
- NanoPi M1 Plus | Resolved an issue where Ethernet did not work because of a faulty kernel patch. Many thanks to @InnovoMagicCube and @InnovoDeveloper for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6974
- DietPi-DDNS | Resolved an issue where the YDNS update test failed due to a changed response from the server API. Many thanks to @NatureHog for reporting and solving the issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7262
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where a mounted drive could be mistakenly detected as dietpi_userdata location.
- DietPi-Software | InfluxDB: Resolved an issue where the service did not start up after the recent package upgrade. The package upgrade removes the symlink /var/lib/influxdb => /mnt/dietpi_userdata/influxdb, which is recreated with this DietPi update. Many thanks to @uwjhn for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/influxdb-not-working-after-update/21868
- DietPi-Software | Node-RED: Resolved an issue where the service failed on ARMv6 systems, since a dependency module of Node-RED v4 does not support this architecture. Node-RED v3 will now be installed on those old RPi models. Many thanks to @mvanbrab for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7252
- DietPi-Software | Chromium: Resolved an issue where optional Chromium flags via "CHROMIUM_OPTS+=" line in /var/lib/dietpi/dietpi-software/installed/chromium-autostart.sh did not have any effect, as "+=" is bash-only syntax, while the script is executed with dash (bourne shell). Many thanks to @Nurgak for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7263#issuecomment-2463626660
- DietPi-Software | MineOS: Worked around an issue where the install failed on Bookworm systems, as one of the Node.js modules failed to compile for unknown reasons. Many thanks to @mikedebian for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7265
- DietPi-Software | MineOS: Worked around an issue where login into the web interface failed since Bullseye, as MineOS does not support the new default yescrypt password hash algorithm for UNIX users. A new dedicated "mineos" user is now created, and its password set explicitly with SHA512 hash algorithm. Many thanks to @maybaxstv for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5759
- DietPi-Software | Node.js: Resolved an issue where node failed on ARMv7 Bullseye systems, since the latest version for this architecture requires a newer C++ standard library than provided on Bullseye.
- DietPi-Software | frp: Resolved an issue where server address and port inputs for the client config generation were parsed incorrectly.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7313

- DietPi-FirstBoot | The network time sync mirror configured in dietpi.txt is now applied before the first time sync is done, instead of after login and initial DietPi update. Many thanks to @bigops for making us aware of this: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/21600
- DietPi-Software | NoMachine: Our install option will now always download the latest NoMachine version, instead of a hardcoded one depending on the DietPi version. Many thanks to @tzvi208 for for figuring it out to version-agnostic download URLs: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7198
- DietPi-Software | Portainer: It has been enabled to accept private/custom CA certificates by using the trusted CA certificates of the host, instead of the ones shipped with the container image. Many thanks to @oldboys92 for implementing this enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7217

Bug fixes:
- NanoPi M3/T3 | Resolved an issue where our recent image did not boot because the bootloader did not define a default device tree path anymore. Many thanks to @rozcietrzewiacz for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2630#issuecomment-2322085507
- NanoPi R5S/R5C | Resolved an issue where the Ethernet LEDs did not work on systems upgraded from the legacy Linux 5.10 kernel. Many thanks to @innovodev for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/21026
- ROCK 4 | Resolved an issue where a false APT component was applied for your APT server, leading to errors and missing kernel/firmware upgrades. Many thanks to @cdlenfert for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/20771
- ROCK 4 SE | Resolved an issue where WiFi did not work if Bluetooth was disabled. Many thanks to @MidG971 and @c00ldchan for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6943
- Orange Pi 3B/Zero 3/Zero 2W | Resolved an issue where enabling Bluetooth via dietpi-config did not work. Many thanks to @ridhoperdana for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/18808
- Bullseye | Solved an issue with our Bullseye images, where the FAT setup partition was not detected, preventing import of config files from it, as well as proper root filesystem expansion. Many thanks to @rozcietrzewiacz for reporting this issue and detecting the actual underlying reason for it: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2630
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where formatting the internal eMMC in drive mode on some SBCs, like Odroid N2, failed. Many thanks to @ankagar for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/20689/33
- DietPi-Services | Resolved an issue where the nfs-kernel-server service did show mode "alias". "nfs-kernel-server" is indeed an alias for the actual service name "nfs-server", which is now used.
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where username and password in proxy settings could not be cleared, since the inputbox kept asking for an non-empty input. Many thanks to @dipisoft for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7211
- DietPi-Software | NoMachine: Resolved an issue where the installation failed due to an outdated download URL. Many thanks to @tzvi208 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7198

- DietPi-Software | Folding@Home: Resolved an issue where the installation failed. Due to larger changes in Folding@Home v8, v7 will be installed for now, before we find time to implement the needed changes for v8. Many thanks to @cruzadernl for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7187

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7246

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v9.7
(2024-08-25)

Enhancements:
- Odroid N2 | Added an option to update (flash) the SPI bootloader to the dietpi-config "Advanced Options" menu.
- Odroid C1 | This DietPi update performs a migration of all Odroid C1 systems which run in "current" branch Linux 6.6 to edge branch kernel with Linux 6.9 or later. This solves non-functional USB ports: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7089
- NanoPi R5S/R5C/R6S/R6C/T6, Orange Pi 5/5 Plus, ROCK 5 | New RK3588 images will be shipped with Linux 6.1 from now on. This DietPi update offers a migration from the legacy Linux 5.10 kernel to this "vendor" Linux 6.1 kernel, from newer and cleaner Rockchip kernel sources. Old NanoPi R5S/R5C images with 8 partitions setup will be migrated to mainline Linux 6.6. Aside of new kernel features, it provides cleaner higher quality code, so we generally recommend the upgrade. However, we do not enforce it, and it makes sense to have a backup in place, and you can do the migration any time later. Next DietPi update, unless there were serious issue reported with the migration, we will enforce it for everyone, to get all RK3588 and NanoPi R5S/R5C systems up to a further supported and updated kernel source.
- DietPi-Banner | An option has been added to show the CPU load as common 1/5/15 minutes averages. Many thanks to @rkok for implementing this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7186

Bug fixes:
- DietPi-Software | Box86/Box64: Resolved an issue where the installation failed because of a false directory removal attempt. Many thanks to @lukaszsobala for fixing this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7149
- DietPi-Software | Bazarr: Resolved an issue where service stops and restarts were hanging until timeout, leading also to hanging system shutdowns and restarts. Many thanks to @clarky000 and @blablazzz for reporting this issue, and @gregordinary for pointing us to the solution: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/19610
- DietPi-Software | WiFi Hotspot: Resolved an issue where the hotspot failed because of an unintended character in the interface configuration. Many thanks to @wimduk for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/20744

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7193

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v9.6
(2024-07-07)

New software:
- soju | This IRC bouncer has been added to our software catalogue. Many thanks to @subnut for implementing it: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7124

Enhancements:
- General | Since we provide all kernel, bootloader and firmware packages from our own APT repository now, the Armbian APT repository is removed from all systems. In case you use an SBC which is not officially supported by DietPi, as generic device, it is however preserved.
- Quartz64/Star64/VisionFive 2 | The extended attribute handler for ext4 security labels "CONFIG_EXT4_FS_SECURITY" has been enabled for these SBCs, required for some Docker containers. Many thanks to @gxsw for reporting this missing feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7102
- Quartz64/Star64/VisionFive 2 | eBPF functionality for firewall and network monitoring software like Cilium has been added to our kernel builds for these SBCs. Many thanks to @kbrighton for reporting these missing features: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6834
- Orange Pi 5 | Older U-Boot builds caused the Ethernet MAC address to be random and change on every boot. Recent U-Boot builds solve this, but they are not flashed automatically on package upgrades. We hence inform users and offer to flash the latest U-Boot image during the DietPi update. Many thanks to @thuehlinger for reporting and testing the case: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6663
- DietPi-Config | Legacy Odroid C2 resolution and GPU memory options have been removed.
- DietPi-Config | The static DNS server menu now contains entries to select the default gateway/router or locally running DNS resolver (Pi-hole, AdGuard Home, Unbound, systemd-resolvd, ...), if detected.

Bug fixes:
- Network | Resolved a rare issue, where shutdowns could hang, when networking.service and ifup@.service instances try to bring down the same network interface concurrently. Many thanks to @ioctl2 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7104
- Odroid C1 | Resolved an issue, where the kernel upgrade did not apply as intended. Many thanks to @th2j for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6332#issuecomment-2162959873
- VisionFive 2 | Resolved an issue where our new image did not boot, because of a false device tree name in /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf.
- NanoPi R6C | Resolved an issue where our new images did not boot, since the latest mainline U-Boot for R6S does not support the R6C anymore. Many thanks to @labmaster for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7109
- DietPi-Banner | Resolved an issue where incorrect RAM usage was printed with German and potentially other locales. Many thanks to @jwgn for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7107
- DietPi-Banner | Resolved an issue where logins as non-root user printed "No certificate found" if the Let's Encrypt cert status option was enabled, since non-root users have no permission to see the certificate files. In such cases, sudo is now used automatically, if the user has NOPASSWD permissions, else a meaningful info is shown. Many thanks to @FrapiFrance for implementing this fix: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7121
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue, where network drives and potentially mounts in general could be attempted to be unmounted on shutdown, before services which can access them are stopped, leading to hanging shutdown sequences and potentially even data loss. Many thanks to @polite-garlic for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/20542
- DietPi-Dashboard | Resolved an issue where the installation on RISC-V systems failed.
- DietPi-Software | Node-RED: Resolved an issue where reinstalls/updates failed because of incompatibilities between latest Node.js or global modules with older local instances. Many thanks to @thinkbig1979 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7128
- DietPi-Software | Fail2Ban: Resolved an issue on Debian Bookworm and above, where Dropbear login failures were not detected due to a non-matching default filter. Dropbear runs as native systemd unit since Bookworm, logging to the system journal via STDOUT, which results in a different log entry prefix. The default filter however has not been updated for this. The fix is as well applied to existing Fail2Ban installs, as long as no own override /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/dropbear.local has been created. Many thanks to @ThePlanplan for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6665

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v9.5
(2024-06-09)

New software:
- Forgejo | This Gitea fork has been added to our software library. Read about the background of this fork here: https://forgejo.org/2022-12-15-hello-forgejo/. Many thanks to @Cs137 for requesting and @jcnils for implementing this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/discussions/6133, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7071

Enhancements:
- Images | New DietPi images won't contain the "gnupg" package anymore, but "gpg" only, since other features of the suite are not required for our scripts anymore. E.g. "dirmngr" for interacting with keyservers, and "gpg-agent" for key passphrase inputs are hence missing. "gpg" however prints very clear error messages about what is missing. Let us know whether you find one of those GnuPG features too essential to not be pre-installed.
- Radxa ZERO 3 | Onboard WiFi does now work OOTB on early ZERO 3W revisions with AP6212 WiFi chip.
- Quartz64/Star64/VisionFive 2 | dm-crypt/LUCS support has been added to the kernel for those two SBCs. Many thanks to @gxsw for reporting this missing feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7091
- DietPi-Software | Jellyfin: Since a while FFmpeg 6 is available for Jellyfin, but on old installs with the old FFmpeg 5 package, it is not upgraded automatically by APT. This DietPi update applies the FFmpeg upgrade to all affected systems. Many thanks to @gioxx and @WolfganP for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7080
- DietPi-Software | MediaWiki: Uploaded images are now preserved on reinstalls.

Bug fixes:
- Odroid C1/C2 | Resolved an issue on both SBCs where reboots could hang and a power cycle was required to get the device back up. Many thanks to @yandritos, @gociii and others for reporting this issue, and @gitmeister for providing the fix for Odroid C2: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5414, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6332
- Orange Pi Zero 2W | Resolved an issue where the onboard Ethernet adapter did not work.
- NanoPi NEO | Resolved an issue where LEDs of this SBC could not be configured, due to a conflicting kernel patch. Many thanks to @mhjessen for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5401
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where Advanced Options were not accessible on some SBCs. Many thanks to @thuehlinger for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6663#issuecomment-2108351878
- DietPi-Software | Snapcast Server: Resolved on issue where on RISC-V systems, the web interface was not available, since it is not included in the "snapserver" package from Debian. Many thanks to @hllhll for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7073
- DietPi-Software | Snapcast Server: Resolved an issue where on Bookworm systems, which installed the Snapcast Server before DietPi v9.4 and reinstalled it afterwards, the server failed to start due to a permissions issue, since the services of both packages use different users. Many thanks to @hllhll for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7073
- DietPi-Software | Shairport Sync: Resolved a DietPi v9.4 regression, where the AirPlay 2 choice did not have an effect, but the AirPlay 1 package was always installed. Additionally, uninstalling Shairport Sync will now also purge the AirPlay 2 package. Many thanks to @pulpe for fixing this bug: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7082
- DietPi-Software | Box64: Resolved an issue where an invalid build target was used on Raspberry Pi 5 with 16k page size kernel. This target was removed with latest Box64, as page size handling is now done at runtime.
- DietPi-Software | Jellyfin: Resolved an issue where the intended HTTP port change could not be applied, since the network config file is not created anymore at service start. We do now pre-create a minimal one, which is complemented with defaults automatically.
- DietPi-Software | ADS-B Feeder: Resolved an issue where the service start could have failed because of a missing Python module. Many thanks to @moonraka for reporting the issue and @dirkhh sending a fix quickly: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/ads-b-feeder-not-working/20601

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v9.4
(2024-05-12)

New images:
- ROCK 4C Plus | Since our Radxa ROCK 4 image has become incompatible with the ROCK 4C Plus, we provide a new image for this particular variant. Many thanks to @lfiorini and @arpegius5555 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6593, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6935
- Orange Pi 3 LTS | Added support for this Allwinner H6 based SBC.
- Radxa ZERO 3 | Added support for this Rockchip RK3566 based SBC, the 3E variant with Ethernet as well as the 3W variant with onboard WiFi.
- Orange Pi Zero 2W | Support for this small form factor SBC with Allwinner H618 SoC was added.

Enhancements:
- General | Our scripts do now internally enforce the default umask 0022. Many config and install options rely on this, hence it can cause issues when e.g. 0027 (deny read access for "other" users) has been applied on the parent shell. This affects only the (sub)shell of our scripts, while the current and default umask of parent and of shells/consoles remains untouched.
- NanoPi R5C | New images, or when flashing the new bootloader binary via dietpi-config > Advanced Options > Update MMC bootloader, support M.2 WiFi modules.
- Orange Pi 3B | Added an option for updating the SPI bootloader via dietpi-config > Advanced Options > Update SPI bootloader.
- Odroid XU4 | The kernel will be upgraded to Linux 6.6.
- DietPi-CloudShell | On Odroid XU4, when using the CloudShell 2 LCD, during configured auto screen off times, the backlight power of the LCD will be disabled as well, to safe energy and avoid still visible black display content. Many thanks to @smac for suggesting this enhancement: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/15331/55
- DietPi-Config | Added an option to the LCD display menu to toggle the Odroid XU4 CloudShell 2 LCD.
- DietPi-Software | Snapcast: 64-bit ARM and Debian Bookworm + Trixie will have the now available packages from Snapcast installed, instead of those from the Debian repository.

Bug fixes:
- NanoPi NEO3 | Resolved an issue where the Ethernet adapter was not available after reboots. Many thanks to @murraythegoz for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6987
- Orange Pi Zero 3 | Resolved an issue on the 1.5 GiB RAM variant, where the Ethernet adapter was not available anymore after soft/warm reboots.
- Orange Pi 5 Plus | Resolved an issue where the Ethernet interface names eth0/eth1 could swap on (re)boot. We add a udev rule which assures they are named persistently based on the PCI bus identifier. In case you created own udev rules to mitigate the issue, please check whether they conflict and decide whether to use ours or your solution. The DietPi update will also inform you about this change with a prompt. Many thanks to @dirkhh and many others for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6592
- DietPi-VPN | Resolved an issue where installing the IPVanish config failed, due to a changed URL, and startup failed on Bookworm systems since their configs contain a deprecated option. Many thanks to @DreamPhreak and @Michael-Robson for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7043
- DietPi-Imager | Resolved an issue where the imager could have failed on GPT partitioned images, if either the source image size did not leave space for the GPT backup partition table, or the first usable LBA/sector was above 34. The GPT backup partition table is now created only at the end of the image generation, not anymore additionally at the start, and the required size it takes is correctly obtained. Many thanks to @SelfhostedPro and @disablewong for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7024, https://dietpi.com/forum/t/18035
- DietPi-Config | Resolved a visual-only failure message on non-RPi systems, when enabling Bluetooth, and an actual failure doing so on Orange Pi Zero 3, Orange Pi 3B and Orange Pi Zero 2W, since the required kernel module "sprdbt_tty" was not loaded. Many thanks to @b9AcE for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/19929/45
- DietPi-Software | Snapcast: Resolved an issue where version 0.27.0 was installed, because since version 0.28.0, Snapcast is provided with client and server packages wrapped into one archive, instead having individual downloads for each package.
- DietPi-Software | OctoPrint: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on RISC-V and ARMv6/7 Bullseye systems, due to changed dependencies.
- DietPi-Software | X11: Resolved an issue where an important config file might have been missing on RPi 5 and potentially Amlogic S905 SBCs, if the config directory /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d did not exist and was not created as part of the related APT packages. Many thanks to @rmscode for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/19963

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v9.3
(2024-04-14)

Enhancements:
- General | We added an own APT repository at https://dietpi.com/apt for own software and kernel/firmware builds. This simplifies updates for software packages like Squeezelite, vaultwarden and Amiberry, as well as allows us to provide own up-to-date kernel and bootloader packages, applied via regular "apt upgrade". A goal is also to become independent of some 3rd party repositories, which are regularly affected by network errors or provide package updates too infrequently.
- DietPi-Config | Removed the 3.5mm audio option on Raspberry Pi 5, as it does not have a 3.5mm jack. Additionally, the KMS graphics driver is enabled OOTB when HDMI audio is selected, as the snd_bcm2835 driver does not work on Raspberry Pi 5. Many thanks to @denguido for making us aware of this: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/19760
- DietPi-Software | Mosquitto: The official APT repository added support for 64-bit ARM on Bookworm, which is now used for our installation.
- DietPi-Software | UnRAR: Debian added unrar packages for RISC-V, which are now used for our installation.

Bug fixes:
- Raspberry Pi 5 | Fixed X11/desktop startup if KMS is enabled. Many thanks to @denguido for reporting the issue and solution: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/19760
- DietPi-Software | Logitech Media Server: Resolved an issue where the install failed due to a changed download URL. Many thanks to @JRK0469 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6992

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7016

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v9.2
(2024-03-16)

Enhancements:
- DietPi-Banner | Support for showing the current RAM usage was added. Many thanks to @Andr3Carvalh0 for the implementation: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6844
- DietPi-Software | It is now possible to run "dietpi-software list" concurrent to other dietpi-software instances, and as non-root user. This avoids an issue in DietPi-Dashboard, where opening dietpi-software in the Terminal and switching to the Software page, caused an infinite hang.
- DietPi-Software | Gogs/Gitea: Using repositories via SSH should now work OOTB with new installs and reinstalls. If pull or push operations via SSH fail in your case, try to give the respective user a default shell: "sudo usermod -s /bin/dash gogs" respectively "sudo usermod -s /bin/dash gitea". This is now included in our default setup. Many thanks to @din14970 for reporting this missing feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/discussions/6964#discussioncomment-8813390

Bug fixes:
- NanoPi R4S | Resolved an issue where Ethernet adapter of the "LAN" port could disappear after a soft reboot. Many thanks to @idaanx for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6342
- DietPi-Globals | Resolved an issue where a concurrent DietPi script detection could have prevented the start of a script, if a previous instance was killed via SIGKILL.
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where a WiFi connection, configured for the first time via dietpi-config from a local terminal session, was automatically stopped when exiting or logging out from the terminal session.
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on RPi systems, where HDMI audio did not work if full KMS was enabled. The firmware/bcm2835 HDMI audio driver conflicts with the full KMS display driver, hence the VC4 HDMI driver needs to be used instead. That one however only supports the IEC958 audio format, which requires a complex ALSA config. This config is shipped with the "libasound2-data" package of the RPi APT repository, but it was overwritten by our /etc/asound.conf. For HDMI audio to work with KMS, the "default" or "sysdefault" ALSA PCM needs to be used by players. This is usually the case, but some allow to select a specific sound card, in which case the ALSA config and plugin for IEC958 conversion is bypassed, breaking HDMI audio. Many thanks to @Lollly2997 for reporting this issue. We are working with Amiberry on a solution for Amiberry in particular. This fix is for the underlying system level: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/19568
- DietPi-Software | PaperMC: Resolved an issue where installing the Geyser and Floodgate plugins failed due to changed download URLs, and a false syntax in the Geyser config file. Many thanks to @boterocamilo for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6898
- DietPi-Software | Nextcloud: Resolved an issue with the updated Nginx config where assets were served with the wrong MIME type. This fix was backported to v9.1 and a live patch offered. Many thanks to @howardroark for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/nextcloud-theme-broken-after-upgrade-v9-1-1/19372
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Resolved an issue on x86_64 and ARMv8 systems where some core integrations did not work if no C++ compiler was installed. If you are affected by this, "apt install g++ && systemctl restart home-assistant" will fix it. Many thanks to @pdsakurai for fixing this issue in our install code: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6931
- DietPi-Software | DarkIce: Resolved an issue where the service failed to start due to false config file permissions.
- DietPi-Software | LXQt: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on Trixie and RISC-V systems, since we did not host a config archive for those Debian versions yet. Many thanks to @jtmoon79 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6939

v9.1
(2024-02-19)

New images:
- Raspberry Pi 5 | Images for Raspberry Pi 5 and other Raspberry Pi models, based on the new Bookworm kernel and firmware package set from Raspberry Pi Ltd, are now available for testing. Note that some features, like changing screen resolution and camera module support, are not working yet: https://dietpi.com/downloads/images/testing/
- ROCK 4 SE | Since our Radxa ROCK 4 image has become incompatible with the ROCK 4 SE variant, we provide a new image for this particular variant. Many thanks to @janno for reporting failing boot on this SBC: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/radxa-rock-4-se-supported-not-booting/19263
- NanoPi R5S/R5C/R6S/R6C/T6 | Our new images for these SBCs use kernel and bootloader builds generated with the Armbian build system. This means that they have a single ext4 partition with kernel image, overlays and boot configuration located below /boot as usual. The kernel command-line arguments can hence be adjusted, kernel headers installed for compiling modules, and the kernel features are more streamlined with other SBCs. The R5S/R5C images ship with a much newer mainline Linux build, which means more modern kernel features and better code quality. But some edge case hardware features which have not been upstreamed may not work, like support for Rockchip's Media Process Platform (MPP) module, used for hardware-accelerated video encoding/decoding by some media servers/players. We are also testing the migration from our old images to the new kernel and bootloader packages, and will likely offer this with next DietPi update.

Enhancements:
- DietPi-Backup/Sync | Both scripts do now only error out when the "rsync" process is already running, rather than on any process which has the term "rsync" in its name. Many thanks to @zuble for implementing this enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6918
- DietPi-Software | Domoticz: Enabled for x86_64 Bookworm and Trixie systems, since the latest x86_64 builds were compiled against libssl3.
- DietPi-Software | vaultwarden: Along with a regular update, RISC-V support has been added.
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: The Python version installed with Home Assistant has been raised to 3.12.1, to align with official appliances. Many thanks to @whyisthisbroken for making us aware if it: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6906
- DietPI-Software | Squeezelite: An update to Squeezelite v2.0.0-1465 will be applied during the DietPi update.

Bug fixes:
- DietPi-FS_partition_resize | Resolved an issue where on Bullseye images, the root partition and filesystem was not expanded on first boot. Many thanks to @naddel91 and others for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/increase-partition-size/19015
- DietPi-Software | Mosquitto: Resolved an issue where the global software password was accidentally applied as username instead of as password: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6886
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on 64-bit RPi systems. Many thanks to @JerichoCross for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6893
- DietPi-Software | GMediaRender: Resolved an issue where the default command arguments were not set correctly on a fresh install. Many thanks to @ransur0t for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/gmediarender-default-args-on-allo-image-for-raspberry-pi/19205
- DietPi-Software | Samba Server: Resolved an issue where our configuration file was not installed if the Samba Client was installed as well, or an SMB/CIFS mount done. Many thanks to @TheCrystalGipsy for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/samba-share-issues-need-help/19224
- DietPi-Software | Pydio: Resolved an issue where web access via Apache webserver did not work, due to an invalid config entry. However, Pydio 8 is not maintained since years, does not support PHP 8 and hence can only work on Bullseye systems. We will migrate to Pydio Cells, once someone finds time to work on this: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3469
- DietPi-Software | OctoPrint: Resolved an issue where system restart and shutdown form the OctoPrint UI failed due to an invalid sudoers rule. Many thanks to @samjw-nz for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6915
- DietPi-Software | Squeezelite: Resolved an issue where in rare cases the service could have started before the network adapter was initialised, in which case it reports a MAC address of 00:00:00:00:00:00 to LMS servers. With multiple Squeezelite players, this could have lead to conflicts among them. Many thanks to @willefg for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/dietpi-squeezelite-players-with-same-mac-address-000000-00/19312
- DietPi-Software | RealVNC: Resolved an issue where the installation was throwing an error, as it was attempted to write to a config file shipped by TigerVNC only.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6921

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v9.0
(2024-01-20)

Breaking:
- The minimum Debian version supported by our scripts has been raised to Bullseye. Buster systems will be migrated to a dedicated branch automatically. We highly recommend affected systems to either flash a new image or upgrade to Debian Bullseye, following this guide: https://dietpi.com/blog/?p=811. Once the upgrade has been done, the update to DietPi v9 will be offered on next update ckeck or when running "dietpi-update".
- The minimum DietPi version to support direct updates to DietPi v9 from has been raised to v7.0. Older systems will go through a two-stage process, being upgraded to DietPi v8.25 with a separate branch, and afterwards further to DietPi v9 via master branch if the Debian version requirement is met as well.

New images:
- Orange Pi Zero 3 | New images for the 1.5 GB RAM variant are now available for testing, before they are added to our download page soon: https://dietpi.com/downloads/images/testing/

Enhancements:
- Raspberry Pi | Further work has been done to better support the Raspberry Pi 5. Our firmware migration script to test it has been reworked to allow selecting/deselecting optional kernel packages, instead of always installing all of them: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6676
- DietPi-Banner | Instead of "Freespace", the "Disk usage" is now shown, including the total disk size and used percent. Many thanks to @Andr3Carvalh0 for implementing this change: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6837
- DietPi-Software | motionEye: Updated build dependencies for ARM and RISC-V, and switched to the recent pre-release from PyPI, instead of pulling from the repositories dev branch.
- DietPi-Software | Moonlight (CLI/GUI): Moonlight has been enabled on Bookworm, as packages are now available.
- DietPi-Software | Logitech Media Server: Re-enabled it for Bookworm and Trixie, now using the latest "stable nightly" builds instead of the "latest releases". Many thanks to @SteveInWA for informing us about the update: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/discussions/6847

Bug fixes:
- Orange Pi 3B | Resolved an issue where onboard WiFi and Bluetooth did not work because the related kernel module was not loaded. Many thanks to @jake5253 for reporting this: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6659#issuecomment-1887072641

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.25
(2023-12-16)

New images:
- Star64 | Support for the RISC-V StarFive VisionFive 2 clone from PINE64 has been added to DietPi. The images are highly experimental, like software support for the architecture in general. Find our images here, before they are added to our download page soon: https://dietpi.com/downloads/images/testing/
- Orange Pi 3B | Support for this RK3566 SBC has been added to DietPi. Find our images here, before they are added to our download page soon: https://dietpi.com/downloads/images/testing/

Enhancements:
- Raspberry Pi | We applied preparations for supporting the new official Raspberry Pi firmware and kernel packages, which implies support for Raspberry Pi 5. A script allows to the migration to the new package set, including the switch for the boot mountpoint from /boot to /boot/firmware. Please see the following topic about how to apply the script. Note that it is in beta stage for now, since the change might cause issues among our scripts which we did not detect yet: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6676
- Quartz64 | The kernel receives a major upgrade to Linux 6.6.7 and we switched to latest unmodified mainline U-Boot 2023.10. Among others changes, this implies a fixed onboard Ethernet MAC address, which was previously changing on every boot.
- DietPi-Software | NZBGet: We migrated to the repository of the new project maintainer, since the original author stopped development: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/nzbget-new-maintainer-dietpi-software-already-updated/18425. Being on it, plain text file logging has been disabled in favour for journal logging, i.e. all NZBGet related logs are now combined in "journalct -u nzbget". The logging change will be applied on next DietPi update, the NZBGet upgrade itself can be done via reinstall: dietpi-software reinstall 149

Bug fixes:
- Proxmox | Now really resolved the issue where the QEMU guest agent was not always installed automatically on first boot.
- DietPi-Update | Resolved an issue on RPi 4 systems with 32-bit userland/OS (but 64-bit kernel enabled) where wrong package variants could have been installed during patch stages. Many thanks to @diment08 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6768
- DietPi-Backup | Resolved an issue where updating or restoring backups between different distro version may have been incomplete (particularly in case of Bookworm and Bullseye), since the /etc/debian_version is identical in size and mtime, and hence seen as identical by rsync (by default), while its content is different.
- DietPi-Software | Ampache: Resolved an issue on Bullseye and Bookworm systems where the initial web UI access failed because our pre-generated database was too old. A template shipped with Ampache will now be used, the initial admin user and music catalogue added via CLI. Many thanks to @mostly_offline for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/bypassing-ampache-update-page/17367
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: Worked around an issue on RPi Bookworm systems where installing Kodi failed due to a missing directory. Many thanks to @joshi0531 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6703
- DietPi-Software | TasmoAdmin: Resolved an issue where the web updater did not work with Lighttpd, due to a wrong rewrite rule. Many thanks to @Boebbele for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6805

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6808

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.24
(2023-11-18)

New images:
- ROCK 5A | We added support for this RK3588 SBC from Radxa to DietPi and images to our download page.
- ASUS Tinker Board 2 | We added support for this RK3399 SBC from ASUS to DietPi and images to our download page.
- Orange Pi Zero 3 | We added support for this Allwinner H618 SBC to DietPi and images for testing: https://dietpi.com/downloads/images/testing/. Note that there is currently an issue with the Ethernet adapter being lost on reboots, requiring a power cycle to re-appear: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6594

Enhancements:
- ROCK 3A | A kernel upgrade from "edge-rk35xx" (Linux 6.1.11) to "current-rockchip64" (Linux 6.1.50 at time of writing) will be applied, which solves e.g. missing 3.5mm audio output. Many thanks to @wahono77 for testing the kernel upgrade: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6710
- Quartz64 | Along with the regular kernel upgrade, we added support for no-UI HID devices. Many thanks to @stormwyrm for the request: https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?pid=120632
- DietPi-Software | openHAB: The openHAB APT repository will be migrated from testing to stable suite. Previously "testing" was used, as "stable" shipped openHAB 3, which does not support Java 17. In the meantime "stable" ships openHAB 4 as well. Many thanks to @twikedk for bringing this back to our attention: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6731
- DietPi-Software | Prometheus Node Exporter: This software option has been enabled for the RISC-V architecture, for which builds are now available via official GitHub releases.

Bug fixes:
- Raspberry Pi 4 | Worked around an issue on Bookworm systems, where the upgrade of the rpi-eeprom package pulled an incompatible raspi-firmware package, causing a failure of any APT upgrade. Many thanks to @piyushaswani55 and others for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6747
- Proxmox | Resolved an issue where the QEMU guest agent was not always installed automatically on first boot.
- DietPi-Globals | Resolved a v8.22 regression where the error handler and bug report template contained only the first line of the failed command's output.
- DietPi-Software | Resolved and issue where auto setup failed in case of trailing (non-integer) characters behind the "AUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED=1" dietpi.txt setting. In this case, an automatic login was performed, but dietpi-software ran in interactive mode. It has been align now so that any trailing characters are ignored and either autologin and automated setup happens both or none. Many thanks to @inis17 for reporting a related issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6719
- DietPi-Software | Sonarr: Resolved a DietPi v8.23 regression where the install failed at an URL check for the APT key. Many thanks to @TheGitGuy00 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6699
- DietPi-Software | NFS Server: Resolved a DietPi v8.23 regression where the install failed because of a syntax error. Many thanks to @supertevran for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6722
- DietPi-Software | Shairport Sync: Resolved an issue where the install failed because of a missing service user required for the new NQPTP version. Many thanks to @vishnusure for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6735
- DietPi-Software | Nextcloud: Resolved an issue where, with Lighttpd webserver, a warning about missing "ocm-provider" rewrite was shown in some cases. Many thanks to @rubinski for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/nextcloud-update-error-message-nextcloud-ocm-provider/18266
- DietPi-Software | NZBGet: Resolved an issue where the log file /var/log/nzbget.log was not created and used as intended, since the service does not have permissions to create it.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6760

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.23
(2023-10-21)

Enhancements:
- Raspberry Pi | On Debian Bookworm and above, the RPi APT repository will be migrated to its new Bookworm suite. This solves issues and should enhance performance with FFmpeg, Kodi and some other A/V software, where we used the Debian packages with less hardware support before. The packages should be upgraded automatically on DietPi update. Please report back if you experience any issues during this process.
- ROCK 5B | Added an option to dietpi-config "Advanced Option" to flash the SPI bootloader, which enables USB and NVMe boot for DietPi images.
- ROCK 4 | Added an option to dietpi-config "Advanced Option" to flash the SPI bootloader, which enables USB and in case NVMe boot for DietPi images. Note that not all ROCK 4 models ship with an onboard SPI storage. DietPi-Config will check for it, in case apply a related device tree overlay and suggests a reboot. If after the reboot an SPI device has still not been found, your board seems to have none. Report back if this is definitely wrong. Many thanks to @andreagdipaolo for doing this request: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6688
- VisionFive 2 | A major kernel upgrade to Linux 6.1 will be applied, including the needed configuration files to read and write the U-Boot environment, and a generic default environment. This allows booting from all filesystems of all partitions of all storage media, including NVMe SSDs, USB, eMMC, SD cards and DHCP/TFTP. This was necessary since the default environment of the latest StarFive U-Boot release does not support booting from any other then FAT filesystems on partition 3 anymore. It is hence necessary to apply our default environment before updating the SPI bootloader. After the DietPi update and a reboot, run "fw_setenv" to do that. Afterwards you can use this command and "fw_printenv" to edit the environment, including the "boot_targets" variable to define boot targets and priorities. Additionally this release will apply device tree overlays to enable 8 GB RAM and A revision Ethernet support. As this is a major change, we recommend a dietpi-backup or even an image backup. We are happy for any feedback: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6212
- DietPi-Software | Firefox: Enabled the software option for RISC-V, since Debian provides packages now. But do not expect good performance, as GPU-acceleration is missing.
- DietPi-Software | ADS-B Feeder: The uninstall has been hardened to rule out the removal of unused Docker images which were not created by ADS-B Feeder. Furthermore, beta tags are now correctly shown in the version string. Many thanks to @andreagdipaolo for reporting a related issue and @dirkhh for implementing the enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6587#issuecomment-1743744008
- DietPi-Software | DietPi-Dashboard: Experimental support for RISC-V has been added. Note that this will be an alpha build with alpha versions of certain dependencies, required to compile on RISC-V. Hence this is not suitable for production usage, which basically applies for RISC-V and the VisionFive 2 in general.

Bug fixes:
- Raspberry Pi | Resolved an issue where the /dev/serial* symlinks were missing if binutils was not installed, which broke Bluetooth support among other things. Many thanks to @Rhiz3K for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6666
- Sparky SBC | Resolved an issue where our current image was not booting because the old initramfs did not support new ext4 filesystem capabilities. Many thanks to @tenoritiger for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/sparky-sbc-allo-not-booting-os/18011
- DietPi daily cron | Resolved an issue where daily APT update checks failed if daily DietPi update checks were disabled. Many thanks to @lz1aam for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6651
- DietPi-DDNS | YDNS has been added to the list of natively supported DDNS providers. Many thanks to @edmundlaugasson for requesting and @TDuffinNTU for implementing it: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5128, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6674
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where the WiFi channel selection was not possible with 5 GHz mode enabled. Many thanks to @lukaszsobala for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6636#issuecomment-1734427451
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where motionEye failed to build on Bullseye systems since piwheels currently have no wheel for the latest Pillow version.
- DietPi-Software | frp: Resolved an issue where the frp client could not connect to the frp server, because of missing spaces around the equal sign for the token setting in /etc/frp/frpc.ini. Many thanks to @josemahj for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6647
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Resolved an issue where the install failed on ARMv6, ARMv7 and RISC-V systems, since new build dependencies are required.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6693

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.22
(2023-09-23)

New software:
- ADS-B Feeder | Track airplanes using SDRs and feed the data to ADS-B aggregators. Many thanks to @dirkhh for maintaining and implementing this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6587
- Kavita | This open source comics/mangas/ebooks media server with a built-in web reader has been added to our software catalogue. Many thanks to @drahen for implementing this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6610

Enhancements:
- Images | DietPi images are now shipped with a trailing FAT partition which contains dietpi.txt and other config files for easier pre-configuration and automation from Windows and macOS hosts. The partition is removed automatically on first boot, after copying all supported config files/scripts. Related CLI flags have been added to our build scripts: "--add-fat-part" for dietpi-imager and "--no-fat-part" for dietpi-build. Many thanks to @dirkhh for implementing this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6602
- Images | All our images are now compressed via xz instead of 7z. These are a little easier to handle, especially on Linux hosts, and many flashing utilities allow to flash zx-compressed images directly to disk, without the need to manually decompress them first. As xz compresses files and no directories, the dedicated README.md and hash text files are not included anymore. The hashes for integrity checks within an archive have no real purpose, as the compression algorithms imply hashes internally (CRC64 in case of xz), which are checked and integrity of the content assured as part of the decompression.
- Images | SHA256 hashes and GPG signatures are now provided for all our images, linked from our download page or found here: https://dietpi.com/downloads/images/. Our public GPG keyring can be found at https://github.com/MichaIng.gpg.
- Images | Most of our images, those with do not ship with a very old Linux version, have no entropy daemon pre-installed anymore. Either rngd or haveged were required previously to assure that the system entropy pool remained sufficiently filled, otherwise boot, service starts, cryptography tasks or anything using random character from /dev/random could have hung. Recent Linux versions however fill the entropy pool from hardware random generators sufficiently by themselves, and have a HAVEGE-like fallback as well if no hardware random generator is available.
- DietPi-CloudShell | The date/time output format at the top of every 3rd scene is now localised.
- DietPi-Software | Docker: Enabled for Trixie and RISC-V via "docker.io" package from Debian repository.
- DietPi-Software | Portainer: Enabled for RISC-V as Docker is now supported on RISC-V as well.

Bug fixes:
- NanoPi R4S | Resolved a v8.21 regression where the Ethernet LEDs did not react correctly after the kernel upgrade. Many thanks to @idaanx for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6342#issuecomment-1697669420
- Orange Pi 5 | Resolved a v8.21 regression where the update may have lead to an unbootable system or caused other issues like missing HDMI output, because of a falsely set device tree file name.
- Odroid C1 | Resolved an issue where the latest kernel upgrade broke boot of the Odroid C1. We do now pin, in case downgrade, and set on hold "current" and "edge" kernel packages of Armbian to v23.02.2 (Linux 5.15.93 respectively 6.1.11) with this DietPi update, which are the latest known functional packages for this SBC. Many thanks to @oskar242000 for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/odroid-c1-not-booting-after-kernel-upgrade/17818
- Bookworm | Resolved an issue where poweroff/reboot/halt commands did throw errors about missing dbus or logind. DietPi ships without dbus and with logind masked by default, as we do not see their features being used on a typical DietPi system. Instead, dbus is installed and logind unmasked on demand on certain software installs or when chosen via dietpi.txt. However, the newer systemd version since Bookworm attempts dbus > logind communication in any case when calling poweroff/reboot/halt, despite no wall message being sent, e.g. to handle shutdown inhibitors (like open SSH session being able to prevent shutdown), and throws errors if either dbus is not reachable or logind not running. Until in case dbus or logind are further tied into common system commands or features, we solved the issue by creating shell functions for poweroff/reboot/halt which call the respective systemd target directly to bypass logind (and hence dbus), but fall back to the original commands, depending on given command-line parameters.
- dietpi-bookworm-upgrade | Resolved an issue on systems with Armbian repository, where the system was still identified as Bullseye after the distribution upgrade to Bookworm. Reason was Armbian's base-files package, which was not upgraded as intended. On all DietPi systems, the original base-files package from Debian will now be enforced to prevent this and similar issues. Many thanks to @rogerthn2019 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6227#issuecomment-1713688577
- DietPi-Config | The menu option to update the SPI bootloader is now shown on Orange Pi 5 Plus as well, as intended. Many thanks for @stealthyvoid for reporting its absence: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6501#issuecomment-1697175109
- DietPi-Software | Ampache: Resolved an issue where the latest version was not successfully detected on install, so that an older fallback version was installed instead. Many thanks to @bartolus39 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6598
- DietPi-Software | Bazarr: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on ARMv6 and ARMv7 Bullseye and Bookworm systems, since some pre-compiled Python modules are currently not available on piwheels, due to the currently running prioritised builds of all modules for Bookworm.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6626

v8.21
(2023-08-26)

New images:
- Orange Pi 5 Plus | Support for the Orange Pi 5 Plus SBC has been added to DietPi with hardware ID 82. Images will be provided on our download page: https://dietpi.com/#download

Enhancements:
- Orange Pi 5/ROCK 5B | An update of the kernel to Linux 5.10.160 will be applied automatically as part of the DietPi update.
- Orange Pi 5 | An update of the U-Boot package will be applied. When flashing it to SPI via dietpi-config > Advanced Options > Update SPI bootloader, it enables booting DietPi via NVMe and USB.
- RK33xx SBCs | All SBCs with RK33xx SoC and Armbian's "linux-image-current-rockchip64" kernel package will receive a major kernel upgrade to Linux 6.1.46, including lots of fixes and enhancements that have been applied upstream and by Armbian in the meantime. Since Armbian's APT repository has not seen any update since February 2023, we started compiling and hosting own builds. An own APT repository is being worked on to better distribute our own package builds.
- DietPi-Config | WiFi Hotspot: When applying settings, manually changed IP addresses in /etc/network/interfaces will now be preserved. Additionally, it is now assured that changing interface names, e.g. due to an additionally attached WiFi adapter, are now aligned across /etc/network/interfaces, hostapd and DHCP server configs.
- DietPi-Config | WiFi Hotspot: Toggles for enabling 802.11ac/WiFi 5, 802.11ax/WiFi 6 (Bookworm only) and 5 GHz WiFi respectively have been added to the menu.
- DietPi-Software | WiFi Hotspot: We added new dietpi.txt settings "SOFTWARE_WIFI_HOTSPOT_WIFI4", "SOFTWARE_WIFI_HOTSPOT_WIFI5", "SOFTWARE_WIFI_HOTSPOT_WIFI6" and "SOFTWARE_WIFI_HOTSPOT_5G" to have 802.11n/WiFi 4, 802.11ac/WiFi 5, 802.11ax/WiFi 6 (Bookworm only) and 5 GHz support respectively enabled on install.

Bug fixes:
- DietPi-Globals | G_GET_NET: Resolved an issue where the default route was not detected correctly if learned via OSPF or other routing protocols which change the output field numbers of the "ip route" command. Many thanks to @owendelong for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6561
- DietPi-Installer | Resolved an issue where building images for ARMv7 hardware was not possible on a ARMv8 host. Offered/accepted ARM hardware IDs are now based on the userland/OS architecture of the image instead of the CPU/kernel architecture returned via "uname -m". Many thanks to @dirkhh for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/discussions/6541
- DietPi-Set_swapfile | Resolved an issue on Bookworm systems where zram swap space was not enabled automatically on boot due to missing syscall permissions, and the swappiness was not changed as intended. Many thanks to @magicfoxt-magicfox for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6511
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | Resolved a v8.20 regression where Lighttpd did not start after applying or renewing the certificate due to a syntax error. Many thanks to @JappeHallunken for fixing this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6517
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where /etc/network/interfaces was created with missing key values if lines were previously manually removed. Defaults are now applied in this case. Many thanks to @huettenwirt for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/ifup-error-due-to-faulty-etc-network-interfaces/17605
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where the DHCP server failed to start after applying WiFi hotspot settings.
- DietPi-Software | TasmoAdmin: Resolved an issue on Bookworm systems with Nginx and Lighttpd webserver where login and logout did not work anymore as the rewrite directives pointed to a file which does not exist anymore since TasmoAdmin v3. Many thanks to @TBirth for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/tasmoadmin-not-found-after-visiting-login-page/17632

v8.20
(2023-07-29)

New software:
- Homebridge | Bringing HomeKit support where there is none. Many thanks to @Zer0x00 for implementing it: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6493

Enhancements:
- Quartz64 | Enabled support for the NFS kernel server and updated the kernel to Linux 6.4.7. The update will be applied automatically as part of the DietPi update. Many thanks to @sewe75 for reporting this missing feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6502
- NanoPi R5S/R5C/6 series | An update of the kernel to Linux 5.10.160 will be applied automatically as part of the DietPi update. Many thanks to @meco for informing us about this opportunity: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/new-kernel-for-nanopi-s-5-10-160/17325

- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | Updated the Lighttpd SSL config syntax and options according to latest Mozilla SSL config generator recommendation with intermediate client compatibility. Many thanks to @JappeHallunken for implementing this enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6481
- DietPi-Software | WiFi Hotspot: The default DHCP server settings have been cleaned up and enhanced, with the default lease time increased from 10 minutes to 12 hours, the max lease time increased from 2 hours to 1 day, and the IP range extended up to 192.168.42.250.
- DietPi-Software | Apache/ownCloud/Pi-hole: The X-XSS-Protection header is now set to "0" in default configs to match recent security recommendations. This change is also applied to all systems on next DietPi update. Many thanks to @Zer0x00 for implementing this enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6491

Bug fixes:
- General | Resolved an issue where the automated first run setup could have failed as images were shipped with cron enabled, which could have led to concurrent APT executions. cron is now disabled first and enabled after first run setup has finished. Many thanks to @Timoses for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/during-initial-boot-could-not-get-lock-var-lib-apt-lists-lock/17385
- Raspberry Pi | Resolved an issue on Bookworm systems where FFmpeg and related A/V libraries and development headers could not be installed, since the raised epoch version of those from the Raspberry Pi repository is leading to conflicts with the newer ones from the Debian Bookworm repository.
- Odroid N2 | Resolved an issue where in rare cases the hardware random generator daemon failed because the kernel driver was loaded too late. Many thanks to @Zer0x00 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6483
- DietPi-Logclear | Resolved an issue where clearing files within sticky bit directories failed. Many thanks to @Timoses for fixing this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6507
- DietPi-Dashboard | Resolved an issue where an attacker could have caused a Denial-of-Service via parallel unanswered TLS handshakes (CVE-2023-38505). The update to the dashboard v0.6.2, which solves the issue, will be applied automatically as part of the DietPi update: https://github.com/ravenclaw900/DietPi-Dashboard/security/advisories/GHSA-3jr4-9rxf-fr44
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | Resolved a DietPi v8.19 regression where applying the HTTPS certificate for Lighttpd fails. Many thanks to @midniteca for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6460
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where enabling Bluetooth on SBCs with Armbian firmware failed, because of a conflict between armbian-firmware and bluez-firmware packages. bluez-firmware will not be tried to be installed anymore if armbian-firmware is. Many thanks to @innovodev for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/upgrading-dietpi-from-bullseye-to-bookworm/15963/16
- DietPi-Software | Lighttpd: Resolved a DietPi v8.19 regression where the installation of Pi-hole, ownCloud, Nextcloud, Pydio and MediaWiki failed if Lighttpd was selected as webserver and HTTPS not yet enabled via dietpi-letsencrypt. Many thanks to @bruno-briner for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6455

- DietPi-Software | vaultwarden: Worked around an issue where since Bookworm the service could have failed to start if DietPi userdata were moved to an external drive. The update, which includes a bump to latest vaultwarden v1.29.1 and web vault v2023.5.0 will be applied automatically as part of the DietPi update. Many thanks to @huidbui25 for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/automount-option-in-fstab-prevents-automatically-mounting-a-partition-in-due-time-on-bookworm/17463

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6498

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.19
(2023-07-01)

New images:
- NanoPC T6 | Our NanoPi R6S/R6C image runs as well on the new NanoPC T6. After some polishing, we merged the hardware IDs to be identified and named as "NanoPi 6 series".

New software:
- MediaWiki | The collaboration and documentation platform which was developed for and is used by Wikipedia has been added to our software catalogue.

Removed software:
- Spotify Connect Web | Development of this Spotify player stalled already in 2018, the underlying library has been deprecated even before that time. The process fails on Debian Bookworm and we have the functional alternatives Raspotify and Spotifyd: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6418. If you need to uninstall this software title after the DietPi update, have a look here: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6427
- Firefox Sync Server | As much as we like the browser and the idea of self-hosting its data sync, it stopped working already on Debian Bullseye, as it requires Python 2, which is EOL since 2020. Work has started on a new token server (one component of the whole stack) written in Rust, but it has been archived again. A sync storage server written in Rust exists, however, we are not able to compose a whole stack in Rust, respectively one that natively runs on modern OS versions. If someone is able to get a whole Firefox Sync Server up without Python 2, we would love to re-add it to our software catalogue. If you need to uninstall this software title after the DietPi update, have a look here: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6427

Enhancements:
- General | Initial detection and support for Debian 13 Trixie (the new "testing" version) has been added to DietPi. Everyone is invited to upgrade to Trixie to stay on bleeding edge. Just note that due to continued breaking changes coming with package upgrades, some features and software installs may break at any time. We are happy to receive your bug report then, to have necessary changes implemented in DietPi as fast as breaking changes in Trixie happen, until it becomes the new stable Debian release, expected in summer 2025.
- DietPi-Software | microblog.pub: On fresh installs and reinstalls, the pyenv Python version will be raised to 3.11.4, matching the version of the official Docker container.
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: The pyenv Python version has been updated to 3.11.4 to maintain compatibility with Home Assistant and align with Home Assistant OS and containers. Many thanks to @whyisthisbroken and others for informing us about this: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/home-assistant-finally-integrates-python-3-11/17033
- DietPi-Software | ympd: We migrated to own DEB packages based on SuperBFG7's ympd fork and enabled the installation option on Debian Bookworm and RISC-V systems. The update will be automatically applied for existing ympd installs as part of the DietPi update.

Bug fixes:
- Quartz64 | Resolved an issue where some iptables/nftables features did not work as of missing kernel features. Many thanks to @acelinkio for reporting the issue and pointing us at the solution: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6389
- Allwinner H3 SBCs | The analogue 3.5mm audio jack can now be enabled as intended via dietpi-config audio options. As it is done via kernel device tree overlay, a reboot is required when switching to or from analogue audio. Many thanks to @eurya and others for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6093
- DietPi-Software | Bazarr: Resolved an issue on Bookworm ARMv6/7 systems where the install failed because of missing dependencies.
- DietPi-Software | microblog.pub: Resolved an issue where the install failed on x86_64 due to a missing new build dependency.
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Since compiling the ha-av Python module for latest Home Assistant requires more recent FFmpeg libraries than provided on Debian Bullseye, sadly it now requires at least Debian Bookworm to install Home Assistant on ARMv6, ARMv7 and RISC-V hardware. Existing Home Assistant instances will remain functional, but on affected systems one cannot update/reinstall it until upgrading to Debian Bookworm: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/unable-to-install-package-ha-av/466286/39, https://dietpi.com/blog/?p=3128
- DietPi-Software | Java JRE: Worked around an issue on Bullseye systems where the JRE package install fails with an error which is gone when just retrying it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.18
(2023-06-03)

Enhancements:
- Quartz64 | Enabled (software) RAID and LVM support. Many thanks to @dano6 for implementing this: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6370
- DietPi-Software | youtube-dl: Since the development of the original youtube-dl project stalled for some years, we migrated to the well known actively developed fork "yt-dlp": https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp. If you installed youtube-dl before, you can migrate via reinstall: "dietpi-software reinstall 195". For backwards compatibility, the "youtube-dl" command will stay valid as a symlink to "yt-dlp", but there are some differences you should be aware about when doing the migration on your system: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#differences-in-default-behavior. Many thanks to @rgabbo for suggestion and @pulpe for implementing this change: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/discussions/5670, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6380
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: With recent release, Pi-hole supports RISC-V and has been hence enabled for this architecture as well in DietPi. Many thanks to the Pi-hole team for making this possible to quickly!

Bug fixes:
- DietPi-DDNS | Resolved an issue where the IP sync failed because the API URL changed recently. Many thanks to @ma651851384 for implementing the update: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6375
- DietPi-Software | Restic: Resolved an issue where Restic was installed without executable flag. Many thanks to @lima1 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6350#issuecomment-1537656560
- DietPi-Software | Domoticz: Resolved an issue where the installation failed when trying to unpack the tarball. Many thanks to @mcnahum for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6369
- DietPi-Software | Domoticz: Resolved an issue where the service start failed because the new version of Domoticz depends on the GnuTLS variant of libcurl instead of the OpenSSL one. Many thanks to @IgrekLg for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6404
- DietPi-Software | motionEye: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on ARMv6, ARMv7 and RISC-V Bookworm systems due to missing build dependencies. Many thanks to @magicfoxt-magicfox for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6333
- DietPi-Software | LXQt: Resolved an issue on Bookworm systems where the install failed since configs were missing.
- DietPi-Software | TigerVNC: Resolved an issue on Bookworm systems where the VNC password was not set as expected since the tigervncpasswd command became a dedicated DEB package "tigervnc-tools".
- DietPi-Software | Deluge: Resolved an issue on Bookworm systems where the install failed when trying to alter the service user.
- DietPi-Software | Mosquitto: Resolved an issue on Bookworm systems where the install failed. The official APT repository does not provide a Bookworm suite yet, and the Bullseye packages have Bullseye-only dependencies. On Bookworm the Debian repo packages will be installed instead now.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6406

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.17
(2023-05-06)

New software:
- openHAB | This long requested vendor and technology agnostic FLOSS home automation software has been finally added to DietPi. Many thanks to @just-jason and many others for requesting it and @MDAR for providing install instructions and valuable information: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3857
- Moonlight (CLI) | This CLI game streaming client for Sunshine and NVIDIA GameStream has been added to our software catalogue. Many thanks to @mtekman for implementing it: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6303
- Moonlight (GUI) | This GUI game streaming client for Sunshine and NVIDIA GameStream has been added to our software catalogue. Many thanks to @mtekman for implementing it: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6339
- Restic | This fast, efficient and secure command-line backup program has been added to our software catalogue. Compared to the package available via APT, it is always the latest version. Many thanks to @goldfix for implementing it: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6350

Enhancements:
- NanoPi R series | Updated udev rules for the Ethernet LEDs to not lid the LEDs of disabled Ethernet devices. If an Ethernet device has been detected by the kernel/udev already and an LED is configured to light on link (connected cable), it lights until the interface is set up and no link is detected. So for disabled interfaces, some LEDs remained lit. The udev rules have now been changed to quickly set up and down the interfaces for the LEDs to remain off until an interface has been successfully configured.
- NanoPi R6S | Since our image runs fine on NanoPi R6C as well, the device name in DietPi is now shown as "NanoPi R6S/R6C" to indicate this fact.
- ROCK Pi 4 | We followed Radxa and renamed the device to "ROCK 4", i.e. removed the "Pi" from its name.
- DietPi-Banner | Added a new option to show the Let's Encrypt certificate status (expiry date), when installed via dietpi-letsencrypt or Certbot. Many thanks to @gary2002 for implementing this option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6314
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | HTTP/2 is now enabled OOTB on Nginx when enabling HTTPS via dietpi-letsencrypt. Many thanks to @Isti6github for bringing up this topic: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/nextcloud-memories-http-2-or-http-3-is-strongly-recommended-http-1-1-detected-nginx/16753
- DietPi-Software | MinIO: On fresh installs, the S3 API port will be 9004 from now on, to resolve a port conflict with Logitech Media Server. Furthermore the web access port (aka console port) will be set to 9001, as otherwise it will be randomly applied from a high port range, making reverse proxy and container setups impossible. Many thanks to @din14970 for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/configuring-https-for-minio-through-nginx/16775
- DietPi-Software | Snapcast: The server and client install options have been enabled on ARMv8 and RISC-V, using the older but functional packages from the Debian repository.

Bug fixes:
- General | Resolved an issue where our recent images had the cron service masked accidentally after first run setup. Many thanks to @Johannes for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/cron-service-is-masked/16544
- Raspberry Pi | Resolved an issue where enabling the 3.5mm analogue onboard audio jack did not work if a HDMI device was attached, since due to a change with Linux 6.1 HDMI audio was not disabled correctly. Many thanks to @Gale for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/no-audio-from-rpi-4b-headphone-jack/16538
- Quartz64 | Resolved an issue where the kernel failed to load the WiFi regulatory database since the cfg80211 module was builtin and hence loaded before the rootfs was mounted.
- DietPi-Globals | Resolved a DietPi v8.16 regression where wrong CPU temperatures were shown on some devices. Many thanks to @duledxb for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6315
- DietPi-Config | Audio: 'firmware-sof-signed' required for functionality on some Intel devices, is now installed when selecting 'intel-sst-dsp': https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6281#issuecomment-1500990841
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where it was possible to install software titles via AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID dietpi.txt entries on unsupported platforms.
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Resolved an issue where to installation on 32-bit ARM systems failed since Python cryptography source builds do now require pky-config. Many thanks to @retrofame for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/unable-to-upgrade-home-assistant-to-2021-10-x/5823/7
- DietPi-Software | HTPC Manager/Synapse: Resolved an issue where to installation on 32-bit ARM Bookworm systems failed since Python cryptography source builds do now require pky-config.
- DietPi-Software | microblog.pub: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on 32-bit ARM devices since a Rust compiler is required for the cryptography Python module build. Many thanks to @kinoushe for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6304
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant/HTPC Manager/microblog-pub/Synapse: Resolved an issue where the install on RPi 4 with 32-bit image failed since rustup/cargo tried to compile for 64-bit. The issue occurred since the 64-bit kernel is used on RPi 4 by default since Linux 6.1, even if the OS/userland is 32-bit. Many thanks to @josh3003 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6306
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on 32-bit ARM systems due to newly required C++ compiler and FFmpeg libraries for compiling all required Python modules.
- DietPi-Software | Google AIY: Resolved an issue where the install failed on ARMv7 systems due to conflicting Python module dependencies.
- DietPi-Software | UrBackup: Resolved an issue where the installation failed since the use "latest" directory has been removed the download server. Many thanks to @mikeruss1 for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/404-on-trying-to-install-urbackup/16744
- DietPi-Software | SABnzbd: Resolved an issue where the service start failed on Buster systems since SABnzbd v4 does not support Python 3.7 anymore. The latest SABnzbd v3 is now installed instead on Buster systems. Many thanks to @githubchonger for reporting this issue: https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/issues/2545
- DietPi-Software | SABnzbd: Resolved an issue where the install failed on RISC-V and ARMv6/7 Bookworm systems due to missing dependencies for Python module builds.
- DietPi-Software | UnRAR: Resolved an issue where the install failed on RISC-V systems, since the non-free "unrar" package is not available for this architecture yet. "unrar-free" is now installed instead.
- DietPi-Software | TasmoAdmin: Resolved an issue with Nginx and Lighttpd webservers where firmware updates failed as direct web access to the firmwares path was denied. Many thanks to @SimonPHP for reporting and fixing this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6328
- DietPi-Software | phpMyAdmin: Resolved an issue where an older version could have been installed since there are still v4 maintenance releases which may be dated after the latest v5 release.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6361

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.16
(2023-04-08)

New software:
- microblog.pub | A self-hosted, single-user, ActivityPub powered microblog has been added to our software catalogue. Many thanks to @mtekman for implementing this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6246

Enhancements:
- General | Reworked GPU driver installations for x86 systems. This provides better control of GPU drivers for DietPi, adding support for Vulkan and resolves issues with Steam Proton. Users will be prompted to select a driver package during DietPi-Update.: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6262
- Network | When checking for one among multiple Ethernet adapters on first boot and generally when all Ethernet interfaces are disabled, all of them are enabled first to allow the detection of a carrier signal, i.e. a connected cable. Previously, eth0 was always chosen in this situation while users may have connected a cable to another adapter. Now one does not need to know or test which adapter is eth0 to have a successful automated first run setup on NanoPi mini routers, VisionFive 2 and similar SBCs with multiple Ethernet adapters.
- Network | The IPv6 connection check is now only done if both, an IPv6 default route as well as a global unicast address (GUA) is assigned. If any of both is missing, the system falls back to using IPv4 automatically, as far as we tested. It hence is not needed to force users disabling IPv6 in this case to assure connectivity to hosts with IPv6 (and IPv4) addresses. Many thanks to @taoteh1221 for reporting a case where our scripts do and fail the IPv6 check while there are no connection issues when ignoring it: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6168
- NanoPi R5S/R6S | The kernel will be upgraded during the DietPi update to disable a writable clk DebugFS flag it was previously shipped with. Many thanks to @thinkpanzer for bringing this to our attention: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6136
- Orange Pi 5/ROCK 5B | The hardware random generator daemon rngd is used now in favour of the software random generator haveged. It will be replaced on DietPi update.
- Orange Pi 5 | Added an option to the dietpi-config Advanced Options menu to update the SPI flash bootloader. This may be needed to enable booting directly from NVMe SSDs. Many thanks to @michaelscott for bringing up this topic: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/orange-pi-5-boot-from-nvme/16457
- First run setup | When connected via local console and the keyboard layout has not been changed in dietpi.txt, an additional prompt allows you now to change the keyboard layout before you are offered to change passwords. This is obviously helpful since the password input fields are masked, hence false characters due to false keyboard layout may not be recognised but bite you later when you cannot login into your installed application. Many thanks to @LeFish1 for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5925
- DietPi-Services | The service handling for software installed via dietpi-software has received a major rework. Previously, services were "disabled" by default, so that the systemd init system did not start them automatically at boot. Instead, they were enabled at a late boot stage as part of the dietpi-postboot service via dietpi-services. The idea was to assure fast undisturbed early boot process and to have all services started up in a specific order, which guarantees that dependencies are running before dependants. But it had several negative implications: systemd is designed to speed overall services startup via parallelism, while our serial startup broke this benefit. "systemctl status SERVICE" showed services as "disabled", which caused confusion as they were still started at boot. Consequently the only way to prevent them from being started was to mask services or exclude them with our script or its config file, as "systemctl disable SERVICE" had no effect. Also it was not uncommon that APT package upgrades left the service stopped, respecting the "disabled" state. DietPi has now been aligned with how Linux distros with systemd handle services commonly. The most important startup ordering is instead done via systemd unit "After=" ordering directives to have e.g. webservers starting after PHP, and PHP after databases.
- DietPi-RAMlog | For unknown historical reasons, the /var/log tmpfs mount had 1777 mode, i.e. was world-writable with sticky bit. Since this does not match the Debian default for this directory, this mode has been removed from the mount options, so that the default mode 0755 is now used.
- DietPi-Config | Added an option to the dietpi-config Advanced Options menu to flash the current U-Boot bootloader to the MMC device if the linux-u-boot-* package of Armbian is installed (true on most SBCs aside of Raspberry Pi).
- DietPi-Config | Display Brightness: Now supports all valid and available sysfs entries in /sys/class/backlight/*. Multiple entries are also supported, allowing users to change brightness levels for all available backlights on the system. Menu system now uses percent based selection for brightness levels. NB: OLED panels (specifically laptops) require a 5.12 Kernel or higher to be supported with this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6288

Bug fixes:
- General | Added more generic support for obtaining the CPU temperature, covering some thin clients and potentially other systems where no CPU temperature was shown when running the "cpu" command or enabling it for the login banner.
- Network | Resolved an issue where WiFi connection may have failed or provided bad performance if the WiFi access point did not send a country code. If no CRDA is used, the country code is now applied via wpa_supplicant. If the access point sends a country code, it overrides the choice once the connection has been established. Many thanks to all community members who reported the issue, tested and provided a solution: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/wifi-drops-out-after-update-to-8-14-2/16082, https://dietpi.com/forum/t/rpi-wifi-stops-working-after-reboot-but-works-again-after-a-proper-shutdown/16406
- Orange Pi 5/ROCK 5B | Resolved an issue where the wrong serial console device name was expected. The correct /dev/ttyFIQ0 will be enabled on DietPi update and patched for a baudrate of 1,500,000.
- Raspberry Pi | With the recent official Raspberry Pi kernel upgrade, Raspberry Pi 4 systems do now boot with the 64-bit kernel by default, even if the underlying OS/userland is 32-bit. While we doubt in any practical benefits, dietpi-software has been patched to correctly deal with this case, i.e. installing 32-bit packages and binaries instead of relying on the "uname -m" kernel architecture output. Some 3rd party software installers may still fail to deal with this case, but we give it a chance for now and hope that affected installers can be relatively easily made compatible.
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where selecting the Nvidia driver on x86_64 systems did not actually install the needed kernel module if kernel headers were not installed before. Headers matching your kernel package are now installed automatically when selecting this option, to have the driver compiled and installed.
- DietPi-Software | Fail2Ban: Resolved a DietPi v8.11 regression where moving logs to systemd journal on install fails due to a typo.
- DietPi-Software | Portainer: Disabled the install option on ARMv6 RPi models since no Portainer Docker image is available for this architecture anymore. Many thanks to @intiplink for making us aware of this: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/armv6-bookworm-software-test-matrix-question/16380/11

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6282

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.15
(2023-03-11)

New images:
- StarFive VisionFive 2 | An experimental image has been added. For details, please read our related blog post: https://dietpi.com/blog/?p=2629
- ROCK 5B | Resolved an issue with kernel upgrades since the boot partition was too small. The image is now shipped without a dedicated boot partition. Many thanks to @isarrider and @skyuplam for reporting this issue and testing the solution: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6206

Removed software:
- Build-Essential | The C/C++ build tools and headers install option has been removed. It was used as generic dependency for other software options, but with the downside that often more packages were installed than required. When compiling is done, specific additional development headers are usually required anyway, so adding the required compiler and in case "make" per software option isn't such a burden. Hence, this has been done gradually and finally finished, making "Build-Essential" obsolete.

Enhancements:
- Quartz64 | Major kernel update to latest v6.1.16, stable U-Boot v2022.04 and enabled a lot of kernel features for various container engines and firewall/filter tasks: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6151. The kernel upgrade will be applied on DietPi update.
- Odroid C4/HC4 | Added support for HDMI audio to dietpi-config. The manual setup via a(lsa)mixer was very complicated. Many thanks to @MDAR for testing the solution: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6178
- VisionFive 2 | Updated Linux to v5.15.98.
- DietPi-Installer | Resolved an issue where conflicting network configurations were left in place, e.g. from cloud-init when running the script on a VPS Debian image. Many thanks to @mews-se for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6067
- DietPi-CPU_info | The script and "cpu" command do not require root privileges anymore. Many thanks to @hansratzinger for bringing this to our attention: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6196. The option to write available scaling frequencies to a file via command argument "2" has been removed as well. This was not documented anywhere and has no use for end users. Internally it was used by dietpi-config, where the code has now been moved to and overall shortened.
- DietPi-Config | VisionFive 2: Added an entry to "Advanced Options" to update the SPI flash bootloader.
- DietPi-Software | XRDP: TLS via snakeoil certificate is now enabled OOTB. This leads to a warning shown on Windows RDP clients until either a proper certificate signed by a trusted CA is used (e.g. by Let's Encrypt), or it is muted for the particular server via checkbox at the client. Many thanks to @amibumping for providing the needed step: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5976
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Our Home Assistant integration used two Python environments: A pyenv is used to install the "homeassistant" core module and its direct dependencies. Home Assistant itself installs its frontend with dependencies on startup, as well as dependencies for integrations on demand, internally into another Python environment. On Home Assistant reinstalls, pyenv is removed but the internal dependencies were left untouched. This caused issues when those dependency builds were incompatible with the new pyenv Python version, or conflicting with other pyenv module upgrades. Both environments are now merged and reset on every reinstall, which solves potential conflicts but means that the first Home Assistant startup after a reinstall takes longer. Many thanks to @maury77 for reporting a related issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6117
- DietPi-Software | WiFi Hotspot: hostapd and the DHCP server are not stopped and restarted on DietPi updates, software installs and backups anymore, since the hotspot might be used by the client which does this task and then cuts its own connection. Many thanks to @symbios24 for making us aware of this: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6166
- DietPi-Software | Box64: Added RISC-V support, as well as optimised builds for Raspberry Pi 3 and RK3588 boards, available since v0.2.2: https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/releases/tag/v0.2.2

Bug fixes:
- Quartz64 | Resolved an issue where the system boots read-only on very first boot. Many thanks to @belveder79 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6149
- DietPi-Sync | Resolved an issue where the prompt after the dry run was shown even in non-interactive mode (input argument "1"), and when selecting "Cancel" or ESC, the real sync ran regardless. Many thanks to @Ruud for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/howto-call-dietpi-sync-1-without-user-interaction/15964
- DietPi-Config | Resolved a v8.14 regression where an invalid post-down interface entry was created when using WiFi Hotspot. Many thanks to @as-shura for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6224
- DietPi-Software | Docker Compose: Resolved an issue where installing and uninstalling Docker Compose could have failed if pip was installed without the distutils module. Many thanks to @bccarbone for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6153
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Resolved an issue where Nginx, if chosen as webserver, failed to start due to an invalid variable. Many thanks to @Trimble-tech for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/pi-hole-install-crashes-nginx/15960
- DietPi-Software | Python 3: Resolved an issue on Bookworm where installs of and via pip failed because the Debian Python 3.11 packages added a flag to prevent system-wide module installs without an override flag.
- DietPi-Software | Synapse: Resolved an issue where the install failed on Debian Bookworm.
- DietPi-Software | Koel: Resolved an issue where the install failed on Buster systems, since Koel 5.1.14 requires at least PHP 7.4. Koel 5.0.2 will now be installed on Buster, being the latest functional one supporting PHP 7.3. Many thanks to @bartolus39 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6226

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6231

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.14
(2023-02-11)

New images:
- Orange Pi 5 | Support for Orange Pi 5 SBC has been added to DietPi with hardware ID 80.
- Odroid N2/HC4 | New images have been generated with support for the default Hardkernel SPI bootloader petitboot. Thanks to this, boot from USB devices is now possible, and on Odroid HC4 it is not necessary anymore to erase the SPI flash or flash mainline U-Boot to it. Many thanks to @hstarcm and @Power-onoff for bringing up this topic and help testing adjustments to the boot script: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5634
- ROCK 5B | New images with ext4 boot filesystem have been generated, to solve possible issues and limitations of the previously used FAT filesystem. Many thanks to @isarrider for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6122

New architecture:
- Initial experimental support for RISC-V and the StarFive VisionFive 2 SBC has been added. This is all in playground stage currently, but if anyone wants to join the party, contact us.

Enhancements:
- WiFi | Since Linux 4.15, the kernel can read the WiFi country code from connected access points, and searches the regulatory database for related allowed frequencies automatically. The Central Regulatory Domain Agent (CRDA) has hence become obsolete and isn't even functional if the kernel feature is used. Linux needs to have the regulatory database in specific format stored below /lib/firmware for this, which is the case since Debian Bullseye. Additionally, if no Debian kernel is used (all SBCs), one needs to change the used regulatory database from a Debian-only one to the upstream one. New DietPi image ship now with this setup without CRDA, it is applied on next DietPi update on Bullseye and Bookworm systems, and it is offered to purge the obsolete CRDA package. This also fixes the issue on Bookworm SBC systems, where the limited global (00) country code was used, since CRDA is not available on Bookworm, but the Debian-only regulatory database used by default.
- NanoPi R2S/NEO3 | Video related kernel modules are now blacklisted on these headless SBCs, saving some bits of RAM and load at boot.
- DietPi-Globals | G_CHECK_NET: When hitting "Retry" from the error handler, the IPv6 connection check is now skipped as well when IPv6 is disabled via dietpi-config network settings or manually. The same is true for changes to the CONFIG_CHECK_CONNECTION/DOMAIN dietpi.txt settings, which can now also be changed right from the error handler. Many thanks to @derSebastian for reporting a related issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5667
- DietPi-Config | It is now possible to change the dietpi.txt network connection test settings CONFIG_CHECK_CONNECTION_IP, CONFIG_CHECK_CONNECTION_IPV6 and CONFIG_CHECK_DNS_DOMAIN via dietpi-config Network Options: Misc menu. Those are used when checking Internet access via IPv4 and IPv6 and DNS resolver functionality.
- DietPi-Config | The user experience of the network adapter options has been improved:
	- When changing the WiFi country code, the network is not restarted anymore and the check whether the country code has been successfully applied, has been dropped. When the kernel applies allowed frequencies directly (see above WiFi changelog entry), the country code cannot be changed anyway, and there are other cases where this fails. It is not worth the hassle of a full network restart only to check whether the country code is valid.
	- If WiFi settings are applied while no SSID has been configured yet, the interface is not tried to be brought up so that one does not need to wait for the DHCP timeout to continue.
	- The dialogue which offers to purge WiFi packages is now only shown if any of those packages is actually installed.
	- System services are not stopped and restarted anymore when applying network changes, but only hostapd and the DHCP server, if installed.
	- Most WiFi handling is now done with the modern "iw" utility instead of the legacy wireless-tools set.
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | HTTP/2 is now enabled automatically when applying HTTPS on Apache. Nginx and Lighttpd have this enabled OOTB already.
- DietPi-Software | Gogs: Our ARMv6 build for Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero (1) models has been updated to latest version 0.12.10. The update can be applied via reinstall: dietpi-software reinstall 49
- DietPi-Software | Docker Compose: Migrated to the plugin variant, installed from the Docker APT repository. On existing installs, the migration can be done via "dietpi-software reinstall 134". To call it, use "docker compose" (without dash) from now on. Many thanks to @isarrider for making us aware of this: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6135

Bug fixes:
- ROCK Pi S | Resolved an issue where the common serial console on UART0 did not show any output and login prompt. Many thanks to @Marsu31 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5972
- ROCK Pi 4 | Resolved an issue where onboard WiFi on ROCK Pi 4C Plus did not work, and potentially other variants than ROCK Pi 4B. Many thanks to @Marco for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/rock4c-no-wifi-hardware-found/15654
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where KVM VirtIO virtual disk volumes were not handled correctly. Many thanks to @bennettp123 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6128
- DietPi-Software | Docker: Resolved a v8.13 regression where Docker dependants (Portainer, Roon Extension Manager) failed to install as the Docker socket was not activated. Many thanks to @omavoss for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6065
- DietPi-Software | ownCloud/Nextcloud: Resolved an issue where a global software password with dashes lead to a failing install. Many thanks to @maxmoonshark for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4199
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: Resolved an issue where intended initial configs were not applied correctly and web UI changes did not survive a service restart.
- DietPi-Software | X11: Resolved an issue where the install failed on ARM VMs with KMS support, where the xserver-xorg-video-vmware package was tried to be installed. Many thanks to @mews-se for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6085
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Resolved an issue where using keyboard LEDs as power/activity indicators did not work, and stopping the service could hang. You can apply the fix by reinstalling Amiberry via "dietpi-software reinstall 108". Many thanks to @DJP75 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5536
- DietPi-Software | Synapse: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on 32-bit ARM systems. Many thanks to @Dark77 for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/matrix-synapse-fails-to-install/15831

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6139

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.13
(2023-01-14)

New images:
- NanoPi R5S/R5C | Our NanoPi R5S image has been verified to work fine on NanoPi R5C as well, and the hardware model has been hence internally renamed to indicate this.

Enhancements:
- General | Reduced log level for kernel logs to console to omit warnings. This matches to what the "quiet" kernel command-line parameter results in and helps to prevent messy display with DietPi-CloudShell, Pi-hole PADD and similar. Many thanks to @Falconcrest for reporting a related issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/pi-hole-padd-problem-under-dietpi-v8-12-1/15299
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: On fresh installs, plain HTTP is now disabled completely but myMPD is accessible via HTTPS on port 1333 only. The myMPD CA for the default self-signed certificate is added to the systems trusted store to allow MPD fetching web radio playlists from myMPD.
- DietPi-Software | vaultwarden: Updated to latest version 1.27.0 with web vault v2023.1.0. The update can be applied via reinstall: dietpi-software reinstall 183
- DietPi-Software | NoMachine: Updated to latest version 8.2.3. The update can be applied via reinstall: dietpi-software reinstall 30
- DietPi-Software | Transmission: The "cache-size-mb" setting is not set to anymore on fresh installs. It was set to 10% of RAM size, which is often too much for a pure download cache. It now defaults to 4 MiB instead. If you experience inconsistent download speeds on an existing install, you may edit or remove the setting in "/etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json". Many thanks to @bbsixzz for bringing up this topic: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5069
- DietPi-Software | UrBackup: The backup path can now be pre-configured with a new SOFTWARE_URBACKUP_BACKUPPATH setting in dietpi.txt.
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Updated to version 5.5.1, including LibSDL2 v2.26.2. The update can be applied via reinstall: dietpi-software reinstall 108

Bug fixes:

- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | Resolved an error with Nginx when multiple "server_name" directives were present in /etc/nginx/sites-available/default due to e.g. a repeating dietpi-letsencrypt/Certbot execution or manually added vhosts. Many thanks to @hemertje for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/nextcloud-problems-questions/15415/13
- DietPi-Software | Readarr: Resolved an issue where the installation failed because of a wrong download URL. Many thanks to @lambolighting for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5992
- DietPi-Software | Docker: Resolved an issue where the install failed if the kernel did not support nftables. Since iptables is installed as dependency along with the Docker package, it cannot be configured first to use the legacy API where needed. The Docker service is now masked before the package is installed, to prevent it from starting during the package install, before we can configure iptables. Many thanks to @tggjifdhn for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6013
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: Resolved an issue where APT updates failed since the myMPD APT repository key expired on 2023-01-01. Many thanks to @cpsjones for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6044
- DietPi-Software | Homer: Resolved an issue where reinstalls failed. Many thanks to @JappeHallunken for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6060

- DietPi-Software | Grafana: For ARMv6 RPi models, RPi 1 and Zero (1), bumped version to latest stable v9.3.0, update via reinstall: dietpi-software reinstall 77
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: On fresh installs, SSL is now enabled by default on the same port 1333 which was previously used for plain HTTP. For plain HTTP, now port 1332 is used, which redirects to HTTPS automatically, but currently cannot be disabled completely.
- DietPi-Software | RPi Cam Web Interface: Renamed to correct project name and removed obsolete motion dependency.
- DietPi-Software | Node-RED: The service user is now added to the "dialout" group by default, to allow using serial console nodes. Many tanks to @devifast for doing this suggestion: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/cannot-connect-serial-port-uart-to-node-red-raspberry-pi/15215
- DietPi-Software | Shairport Sync: Updated to latest version 4.1.1. The update be applied via reinstall: dietpi-software reinstall 37

- Odroid C2 | Resolved an issue where USB devices were not detected. Many thanks to @esage85 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5963
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard: It was incorrectly still offered for legacy Odroid systems with vendor kernel, while recent WireGuard does not support those old kernel versions anymore. We hence did now disable the WireGuard install options for those. Many thanks to @brtravel for reporting the failed install: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/wireguard-install-failed-now-cant-do-anything-else-with-dietpi-software/15173
- DietPi-Software | PaperMC: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on Raspberry Pi ARMv6 images (with ARMv7/8 hardware), since latest PaperMC cannot run on Java 11. Since Java 17 binary packages are finally available via Raspbian and Raspberry Pi repositories, those can be installed now, allowing PaperMC to run. Many thanks to @blueyshark for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5668
- DietPi-Software | Grafana: Resolved an issue where the uninstall failed when trying to remove the "grafana" user. Many thanks to @enviousjag for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5935
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: Resolved an issue where the installation as well as the service start after latest myMPD release failed. Many thanks to @jalsco and @sofad for reporting these issues: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5936, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5919

Enhancements:
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Updated to version 5.4, including LibSDL2 v2.24.1. The update can be applied via reinstall: dietpi-software reinstall 108
- DietPi-Software | Squeezelite: Updated to version 1.9.9-1411, fixed install on Debian Bookworm and added support for the Opus audio codec format. Also the default command-line arguments have been enhanced to not enforce the audio format anymore, and they can now be easily adjusted via /etc/default/squeezelite. The update can be applied via reinstall: "dietpi-software reinstall 36". Many thanks to @scan80269 and @aposcic for doing this suggestions: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4428, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5791
- DietPi-Software | Shairport Sync: Updated to final version 3.3.9 release and added support for the "pipe" and "stdout" audio backends. The update can be applied via reinstall: "dietpi-software reinstall 37". Many thanks to @foxy82 for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4470
- DietPi-Software | vaultwarden: Updated to version 1.26.0, including web vault v2022.10.1. The update can be applied via reinstall: dietpi-software reinstall 183
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: The Home Assistant Community Store (HACS) is now installed by default. For existing installs, do a reinstall: "dietpi-software reinstall 157". To activate HACS, follow this guide: https://hacs.xyz/docs/configuration/basic/. Many thanks to @pbanj for pointing us to this option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4709#issuecomment-1192069367
- DietPi-Software | GMediaRender: Updated to version 0.0.9 and aligned service name with Debian and upstream service and executable name. The update can be applied via reinstall: dietpi-software reinstall 163

Bug fixes:
- General | Resolved an issue where on some SBCs old initramfs images were not cleaned up.
- Raspberry Pi | Resolved an issue where some I2C and SPI device drivers were not loaded. Many thanks to @f-laurens and others for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5789
- DietPi-CloudShell | Pi-hole: Fixed stats with recent Pi-hole version as the port file is not used anymore. Many thanks to @oradke for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5810
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where it was not possible to disable the swap file with less than 2 GiB available free space on that drive. The check was meant to prevent the creation of a swap file with limited free space, while disabling/removing a swap file should of course always be possible. Furthermore the 2 GiB free space requirement has been removed completely, which has no point on non-system drives and is too strict even on system drives which, depending on the setup, can run fine with much less free space. Many thanks to @symbios24 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5749#issuecomment-1257169750
- DietPi-Software | FreshRSS: Resolved an issue where the install failed because of changed branches on the GitHub repository. Many thanks to @baptiste313 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5767
- DietPi-Software | Roon Bridge: Resolved an issue where the internal updater failed because of insufficient permissions. Many thanks to @Tristan_Harward for reporting this issue: https://community.roonlabs.com/t/roon-bridge-on-dietpi-impossible-to-update-from-build-164-to-167-resolved-by-dan-knight-dietpi-creator/52303/80

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5814

v8.9
(2022-09-24)

Enhancements:
- Raspberry Pi | The raspberrypi-sys-mods package has been replaced with an own one, using only the small subset of the contained tweaks, which are useful on DietPi as well. A recent update of the package added a large number of dependencies, required for rpi-imager setup steps on Raspberry Pi OS only: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5734
- NanoPi R5S | The Ethernet LEDs have been enabled. Many thanks to @3735943886 for providing the related sysfs triggers: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5679
- DietPi-Installer | The root user home directory and login shell are now reset to /root and /bin/bash, as expected by the fresh DietPi system. Many thanks to @symbios24 for reporting a case where root logins did fail because zsh was the login shell, but missing on a fresh DietPi system: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5749
- DietPi-Survey/DietPi-BugReport | From Debian Bookworm on, for survey and bug report uploads to DietPi servers, the deprecated RSA host key algorithm has been replaced by the modern Ed25519 algorithm. The known hosts entry has been additionally hardened to allow only connecting to a specific non-default port.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | mergerfs fstab entries are now preserved. Many thanks to @paradix for suggesting this enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5622
- DietPi-Software | Plex Media Server: The "plex" system group is now removed on uninstall. This was not done automatically on package removal, since we change the primary group of the "plex" system user to "dietpi". Many thanks to @mail2rst for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/plex-installation-broken-via-dietpi-software-after-uninstallation-of-docker-docker-compose/14130
- DietPi-Software | Go: GOPATH is not set anymore to /mnt/dietpi_userdata/go on fresh installs and will default to ~/go instead. This especially makes multi-user setups easier where usually every user wants its own Go workspace. Many thanks to @tlgs for bringing this to our attention: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5735
- DietPi-Software | HAProxy: Bumped version to latest stable v2.6.5, update via reinstall: dietpi-software reinstall 98
- DietPi-Software | phpBB: Bumped version for new installs to latest stable v3.3.8, update it by following the instructions on the web UI ACP.
- DietPi-Software | NoMachine: Bumped version to latest stable v7.10.1_1, update via reinstall: dietpi-software reinstall 30

Bug fixes:
- DietPi-Imager | Resolved an issue where the script could have failed because of a missing directory. Many thanks to @DrCWO for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5750
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue with the reserved blocks option where the entered value was accidentally applied as number of blocks instead of as MiB, leading to a much smaller reserved space as intended.
- DietPi-Software | ownCloud: Resolved an issue where the install failed because of a changed download URL. Many thanks to @DrMoshSince1988 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5739
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Resolved an issue where mouse movement did not work because of change in the latest libSDL2 version. Many thanks to @lilltonka for reporting this issue and @midwan for the fix in upcoming Amiberry v5.4: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5730, https://github.com/BlitterStudio/amiberry/issues/995

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5760

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.8
(2022-08-28)

New features:
- DietPi-Imager | It is now possible to skip the 7z archive creation but have the raw image file created only. Many thanks to @DrCWO for requesting this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5687

Enhancements:
- DietPi-Imager | It is now possible to shrink the originating image's/drive's filesystems and partitions only, instead of creating a new image file from it by passing/exporting the variable "SHRINK_ONLY=1".
- DietPi-Imager | The dietpi-fs_partition_resize.service is now enabled automatically on the source image/drive before it is shrunk. This way it is assured that the shrunk original system as well as the newly created image will have their root partition and filesystem expanded automatically on next boot. Many thanks to @DrCWO for suggesting this enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5672

Bug fixes:
- DietPi-Installer | The common Debian images on Linode VPS can now be converted into DietPi. This was previously failing since these images intentionally do not contain a partition table, so that GRUB cannot be flashed. Many thanks to @mews-se for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5691
- DietPi-Software | vaultwarden: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on Buster systems. Many thanks to @anubis-genix for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5681
- DietPi-Software | vaultwarden: Resolved an issue where reinstalls onto existing pre-v1.25 vaultwarden installs lead to missing remote web vault access. Many thanks to @jetspeed for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/vaultwarden-update-command-fail-then-vaultwarden-not-start-even-after-reboot/13350/68

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5715

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.7
(2022-07-30)

New images:
- NanoPi R5S | Initial support for FriendlyELEC's new router SBC has been added, with three Ethernet ports, up to 2.5 Gbps, based on the new Rockchip RK3568 SoC.

New software:
- Readarr | The ebook manager of the Servarr family has been added as dietpi-software option.
- Navidrome | An open source web-based music collection server and streamer has been added as dietpi-software option.

Enhancements:
- Quartz64 | The firmware package has been updated to ship with Linux v5.19-rc1. You will be asked during dietpi-update whether you want to upgrade it on your system.
- DietPi-Globals | The network connection checks during first boot, dietpi-update and dietpi-software installs have been enhanced: The timeout can be doubled and network settings can be entered right from the error handler menu. A dedicated IPv6 check is done and if it fails, IPv6 can be disabled from the error handler menu. The DNS check does no ping any more, but only tries to resolve the test domain.
- DietPi-Software | Prowlarr: Logging is now done to /var/log/prowlarr as intended. For this change to take effect, existing instances need to be reinstalled once: dietpi-software reinstall 151
- DietPi-Software | vaultwarden: DEB packages are now hosted on dietpi.com, replacing the time consuming in-place compiling. This also solves issues where builds failed due to insufficient memory.
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: The web interface and web server dialogues from the Pi-hole installer are now skipped. Since we force the installation of a web server and PHP, but allow to choose the web server freely, not installing the web interface as well as installing Pi-hole's Lighttpd setup are no reasonable choices.

Bug fixes:
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where "cgroup_enable=memory" was unnecessarily added multiple times on Raspberry Pi when installing or reinstalling container engines. Many thanks to @mdsjip for fixing this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5600
- DietPi-Software | Webmin: Resolved an issue where the service failed to start. Many thanks to @alucard87pl for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5594
- DietPi-Software | Raspotify: Resolved an issue where the service failed to start on ARMv6 RPi models (Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero (1)). It is not supported by latest Raspotify anymore, so we install the latest ARMv6-compatible version instead. Many thanks to @dvelluto for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5602
- DietPi-Software | Rclone: Resolved an issue where on ARMv6 the x86_64 package was attempted to be installed. Many thanks to @eddiermar for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5601
- DietPi-Software | Unbound: Resolved an issue on Debian Bookworm where the service failed to start because of missing root trust anchors. Many thanks to @smittyj for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5612
- DietPi-Software | Tailscale: Resolved an issue where APT updates failed after Tailscale was uninstalled. Many thanks to @SlowRaid for resolving this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5623
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Resolved an issue where the dialog windows looked ugly when executed via SSH and keyboard inputs caused characters to appear on the screen.
- DietPi-Software | Bazarr: Worked around an issue where on ARMv8 systems the service failed to start since for some reason the previously working aarch64 unrar binary (which is actually an ARMv5tel one) does not work on recent arm64 Debian anymore. A fix with a real aarch64 binary has been sent upstream. Many thanks to @dioxide0363 for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/bazarr-fails-to-start-on-freshly-installed-dietpi/13658

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.6
(2022-07-02)

New images:
- Quartz64 | Support and images for the PINE64 Quartz64 series have been added to DietPi, modern feature-rich SBCs based on the new Rockchip RK3566 SoC.

New software:
- Prometheus Node Exporter: A Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics, written in Go, has been added to the DietPi software catalogue. Many thanks to @alexiri for implementing this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5551
- Tailscale: A new VPN server option has been added to the DietPi software catalogue. Many thanks to @goldfix for implementing this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5558
- Rclone: "rsync for cloud storage" has been added to the DietPi software catalogue. Many thanks to @goldfix for implementing this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5560
- ZeroTier: The free easy to deploy cloud-hosted VPN service has been added to the DietPi software catalogue. Many thanks to @AAS-Crypt for implementing this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5567

New features:
- DietPi-Software | PiVPN: It is now possible to do an unattended install by placing a config file named "unattended_pivpn.conf" into the boot partition/directory. For example configs, have a look at https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn/tree/master/examples. Many thanks to @bastianpaetzold for implementing this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5546

Enhancements:
- DietPi-Software | HAProxy: It received some updates and enhancements, using v2.6.0 sources now, enabled support for prometheus metrics, updated cipher suites, and the initial password for the admin panel is now the global software password instead of hardcoded "dietpi". All config file changes affect fresh installs only, while reinstalls will never touch the config file, but update the HAProxy binary only: "dietpi-software reinstall 98"
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Our package has been updated to latest v5.3. Run "dietpi-software reinstall 108" to update your instance: https://github.com/BlitterStudio/amiberry/releases/tag/v5.3

Bug fixes:
- Odroid N2 | Resolved an issue where our image didn't boot from Hardkernel eMMC modules with orange PCB. Many thanks to @greentea1 for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/problem-for-my-n2/13426
- DietPi-VPN | Resolved an issue where NordVPN, IPVanish and PIA connections failed if the killswitch was enabled. Many thanks to @jonyskids for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/dietpi-vpn-blocking-443/13348
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | Resolved an issue where Lighttpd needed to be reloaded manually after certificate renewals to serve the new certificate. Many thanks to @Rednox for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/letsencrypt-renew-cron-issue/13471/6
- DietPi-Software | Radarr: Resolved an issue where the installation on ARMv6 Raspberry Pi models (Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero (1)) failed, since Radarr v4 does not support Mono anymore. The latest v3 will be installed now on these models. Many thanks to @eddiermar for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5537
- DietPi-Software | Lidarr: Precautionary, on ARMv6 Raspberry Pi models, the latest v0.8 will be installed from now on, since the upcoming v1 won't support Mono anymore.
- DietPi-Software | Jellyfin: Resolved an issue where the installation failed due to a missing config file. Many thanks to @TomEighty15 for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/jellyfin-installation-error/13402
- DietPi-Software | vaultwarden: Resolved an issue where the installation could have failed due to insufficient system memory.
- DietPi-Software | WiringPi: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on Odroids because of a missing dependency. Many thanks to @Guchshenskaya for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5543

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5591

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.5
(2022-05-28)

New software:
- Prowlarr | The indexer manager of the Servarr family has been added as dietpi-software option.

Changes:
- Security | It is now possible to enter the WPA-PSK WiFi key as 64-digit hexadecimal key, as e.g. returned by "wpa_passphrase". It will be converted as needed, stored and applied to wpa_supplicant config automatically in this format. In case of using "dietpi-wifi.txt" on a fresh DietPi installation, please note that this requires an image with DietPi v8.5 pre-installed, i.e. dated after May 28, 2022. Many thanks to @robinemde for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5406
- Security | It is now possible to add public SSH keys to dietpi.txt, to be applied at first boot for public key authentication with "dietpi" and "root" users. Additionally, SSH password authentication can be disabled for all users or "root" only. Have a look at "AUTO_SETUP_SSH_PUBKEY" and "SOFTWARE_DISABLE_SSH_PASSWORD_LOGINS" settings in /boot/dietpi.txt.
- DietPi-Software | Dropbear/OpenSSH: Password authentication is now disabled if set via "SOFTWARE_DISABLE_SSH_PASSWORD_LOGINS" setting in /boot/dietpi.txt.
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Updated to latest version 5.2 and shipped now as DEB package. Also the included libSDL2 libraries have been updated to latest stable versions. Additionally builds for all SBCs and architectures, including x86_64, have been added, i.e. Amiberry is now available on all platforms.
- DietPi-Software | WiringPi: Build dependencies have been reduced so that only the actually required tools and headers are installed instead of the whole Build-Essential package.

Fixes:
- DietPi-VPN | Resolved an issue where applying a ProtonVPN connection or starting the killswitch could have failed, if the "gettext-base" package was not installed. Many thanks to @Wilford888 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5501
- DietPi-Software | Spotifyd: Resolved an issue where fresh installs failed because of a missing parent directory. Many thanks to @C0ntroller for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5484
- DietPi-Software | WiringPi: Resolved an issue where the install on Odroids failed as of a change in the build scripts of Hardkernel's fork. Many thanks to @MDAR for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5485
- DietPi-Software | Gitea: Resolved an issue where the service failed to start after a reinstall when Gitea was installed before DietPi v7.9. Many thanks to @twikedk for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5516
- DietPi-Software | vaultwarden: Resolved an issue where web access wasn't possible, since it binds to localhost with recent vaultwarden or web vault release. We restore the previous behaviour on fresh installs and reinstalls, but preserve any stricter value that may have been manually applied, like the local IP. Many thanks to @amibumpin for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/vaultwarden-update-to-1-25-web-access/13248

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5522

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.4
(2022-04-30)

New images:
- NanoPi M2/T2/Fire2 | We updated our NanoPi 2 series image to be shipped with Linux 4.4, the latest Linux version for the S5P4418 SoC, provided by FriendlyELEC. It is compatible will all FriendlyELEC S5P4418 SBCs: NanoPi 2, NanoPi M2, NanoPC T2, NanoPi Fire2A, NanoPi 2 Fire and NanoPi S2. Sadly systems running the old image cannot be upgraded, since the new U-Boot requires more space and hence a different partitioning. The new image ships with two scripts to flash U-Boot and to change the U-Boot environment/config: One can now edit /boot/u-boot/env.txt and apply the changes by running /boot/u-boot/flash_env.sh. Run fw_printenv to see the current U-Boot environment, also to get an idea of available settings. Kernel, U-Boot, firmware and these scripts are installed as part of a self-hosted "firmware-nanopi2" package. The kernel sources can be found at https://github.com/friendlyarm/linux/tree/nanopi2-v4.4.y, so that headers can be compiled. We will probably provide a kernel headers package as well, if there is a demand, e.g. to enable the DKMS-based WireGuard VPN server software option.
- Odroid XU4 | We updated our Odroid XU4 image to be shipped with Linux 5.4. Sadly systems running the old image cannot be upgraded, since the new U-Boot config requires a single ext4 partition without a dedicated boot partition.

Removed software:
- OpenBazaar | This software option has been removed from DietPi. The original project has been officially abandoned a while ago and a fork we recently switched to sadly doesn't show any activity anymore, leaving broken installs on ARM and no fully compatible clients. Since we really like the approach, as fast as there is a reliable and trustable revival of OpenBazaar, we will re-implement it, but for now it simply isn't functional. If you have OpenBazaar still installed on your DietPi system, see here for ways to uninstall it: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5465

CLI changes:
- DietPi-Set_software | The "apt-cache" command has been renamed to "apt" to better reflect its options, which do not cover the APT cache only, but APT lists and the location of the downloaded package archive as well. For backwards compatibility, "apt-cache" however remains valid for now.

Changes:
- Security | Access permissions for /etc/sudoers.d/dietpi have been hardened to comply with best practice. Many thanks to @fmunteanu for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5441
- DietPi-Config | It is now possible toggle APT list compression. APT package lists are xz-compressed by default on DietPi, which reduces disk writes during APT updates and disk usage of APT lists by about 80%. But it slows down APT installs/upgrades, especially when a large number of packages is installed/upgraded, since parsing compressed lists for e.g. building the dependency tree is done quite inefficiently. The option can be found in "dietpi-config" > "Advanced Options" > "APT".
- DietPi-Software | The webserver, desktop and browser "preference" menus have been removed, in favour of an interactive dialogue once respective dependant software is to be installed. Those menus have always caused confusion, since selecting e.g. a specific desktop didn't cause this desktop to be installed, unless another software was selected which requires a desktop to work. For automated first run installs, the respective dietpi.txt settings are still respected.
- DietPi-Software | Box86: On ASUS Tinker Board, compiling is now done with an optimised build target flag. You can update Box86 by reinstalling it: dietpi-software reinstall 62
- DietPi-Software | Box64: On Odroid N2, compiling is now done with an optimised build target flag. You can update Box64 by reinstalling it: dietpi-software reinstall 197
- DietPi-Software | VirtualHere: On new installs and reinstalls, VirtualHere is now installed to /opt/virtualhere to align with most other software options. Logging is now done to system log, viewable via "journalctl -u virtualhere", instead of using the /var/log/virtualhere.log plain text file. By default, the system hostname is now used as VirtualHere server name, instead of the hardcoded "DietPi". An existing config file is never touched on reinstalls.
- DietPi-Software | rTorrent: The ruTorrent web interface is now reinstalled cleanly, i.e. configs, 3rd party plugins and themes are preserved but all other files are removed before new ruTorrent files are installed. Many thanks to @shanew1694 for reporting a related issue with remaining obsolete files: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5161#issuecomment-1013286248

Fixes:
- Network | Resolved an issue on some Armbian based systems where the network interface naming changed unintentionally after a kernel upgrade.
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on RPi where disabling and re-enabling Bluetooth failed, since the hciuart.service cannot be restarted until reboot after it was stopped once. In the same turn, this also resolved an issue in DietPi-PREP where the service is still running after package removal, while trying to disabling it fails as of the missing service file. Many thanks to @Mausy5043 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5435
- DietPi-Software | Chromium: Resolved an issue on Raspberry Pi Buster systems where the installation failed because of a syntax error. Many thanks to @bbmak for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Tor/Unbound: Resolved an issue where IPv6 usage was assumed only based on the dietpi.txt setting instead of on whether IPv6 can really be used for Internet connections. E.g. when a VPN connection is established, usually IPv6 is disabled to prevent IPv6 leaks, without changing the general dietpi.txt setting. Tor and Unbound service starts however fail then, trying to bind to the IPv6 port. If the adapter has an IPv6 address assigned, but no IPv6 default route, binding to the IPv6 port succeeds, but Internet connections via IPv6 are not possible, which isn't better. On the other hand, using IPv4 only while IPv6 is enabled, has no real downsides. Many thanks to @Wgsem for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5412
- DietPi-Software | Python 3: Updated the workaround for ARMv6/7 Buster systems where installing numpy or any module which depends on numpy failed. It was accidentally applied only on Raspberry Pi 2 and earlier, while it should have been applied to all ARMv6/7 Buster systems. Additionally, all numpy >=0.21.5 versions are now blocked, since the recent v0.21.6 fails to compile for the same reason.
- DietPi-Software | Single File PHP Gallery: Resolved the failing installation since a new version is available and the old download link has become invalid. Many thanks to @dodo1967 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5415
- DietPi-Software | WiFi Hotspot: Resolved an issue where the WiFi country code was not applied when the WiFi Hotspot was installed via automated first run setup. Many thanks to @matteocarnelos for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5407

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5460

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.3
(2022-04-02)

New images:
- Container | Initial support for container systems has been added to DietPi, using hardware ID 75. For now it is assumed that the container guest does not require an own network stack, but uses the host network interface or one managed by the container engine. This works well with systemd-nspawn which we use for DietPi image generation and for testing DietPi features in CI/CD pipelines. Further support and images for specific container engines, like Docker or LXC with Proxmox and QEMU will follow.

New software:
- PHP Composer | The PHP package manager has been made a dedicated install option.

Changes:
- DietPi-Banner | It is now possible to hide the credits section from the DietPi banner. Run "dietpi-banner" to configure its content. Many thanks to @math-gout for contributing this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5355
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Adding an NFS drive now allows to select a specific export from an NFS server, detected via "showmount -e <IP/hostname>". Entering a custom path is still possible, including the single slash "/" which was always used before. If the NFS server has no root export defined via "fsid=0", this solves the issue that the full root directory structure is mounted and allows to mount multiple shares from the same server. Many thanks to @bamyasi for doing this suggestion.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | NFS and Samba network drives can now be mounted to any directory on the server, not necessarily below /mnt.
- DietPi-DDNS | It is now possible to select the IP family to associate with your DDNS domain. For new setups, IPv4 is used by default for best compatibility. If you configured your DDNS domain already, no IP family is forced to not change existing behaviour, unless selected explicitly. We recommend to use IPv4 so that your server can be reached with any client from any network, regardless whether client and network support IPv6 or not. Many thanks to @TomBayne for suggesting this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5354
- DietPi-Software | motionEye: We worked together with other contributors to revive motionEye and port it over to Python 3, which also allowed us to re-enable it on Debian Bullseye systems. It requires further careful testing before a stable release can be done, but common functionality works. We enabled it with a "beta" mark in DietPi-Software. Visit the new home of motionEye, and if you want, contribute or help testing: https://github.com/motioneye-project/motioneye
- DietPi-Software | Node-RED: The "nodered" service user is now added to the "spi" system group automatically, relevant on Raspberry Pi to grant it access to SPI-attached sensors and similar. Many thanks to @devifast for reporting a related issue.
- DietPi-Software | TasmoAdmin: Reduced the downloaded data size from ~150 MiB to ~4 MiB by downloading the runtime files of the latest release only instead of the whole GitHub repository archive.

Fixes:
- NanoPi NEO3 | Resolved an issue where the board became unbootable after an "apt upgrade" because the latest version of the Armbian kernel does not ship a NEO3 device tree anymore. On DietPi upgrade, it is switched to the NanoPi R2 rev00 device tree, which works regarding Ethernet, USB and general GPIO interface: https://forum.armbian.com/topic/20133-nanopi-neo3-dtb-gone-since-linux-dtb-current-rockchip64-22021/
- Raspberry Pi | Resolved an issue where enabling and using onboard WiFi during first run installs was failing if a reboot was done after first run update due to a kernel upgrade. Many thanks to @matteocarnelos for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5391
- Network | Resolved an issue where the systemd network targets could have been reached before the network adapter was even detected. Many thanks to @Totila for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-WiFi-Monitor | The first default gateway check is now done after the first tick rate interval instead of immediately after service start. This adds another grace period at boot to reduce the chance that the WiFi monitor reconfigures the interface which is just about to be configured for the first time. This should usually not be required, but may help with cases where the initial DHCP lease or WPA authentication time out or fail.
- DietPi-TimeSync | Resolved an issue where the script threw a syntax error where it shouldn't, which however didn't affect functionality. Many thanks to @adminy for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5347
- DietPi-Login | Resolved an issue where a prompt about an unsupported SSH client terminal was incorrectly shown. Many thanks to @jahway603 and @Dagon for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5341, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5366
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Worked around an issue on Bullseye with legacy Linux versions, where exFAT filesystems failed to mount since the exFAT driver for FUSE is not invoked automatically if the native kernel driver is missing. A symlink for "mount.exfat => mount.exfat-fuse" is now created in these cases to force this invocation, and it is removed as fast as due to a kernel upgrade, the native exFAT driver becomes available. Many thanks to @RunningUtes for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5166
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: Resolved an issue on Raspberry Pi Bullseye systems where libraries were missing to run Kodi via KMS/DRM. Many thanks to @derebo for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Mopidy: Resolved an issue where there installation failed. Many thanks to @amibumpin for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | rTorrent: Resolved an issue where the web interface didn't work with Nginx because the PHP handler wasn't set. Many thanks to @vinhtq115 for providing the solution: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5375
- DietPi-Software | Webmin: Worked around an issue where the install failed. Many thanks to @omavoss for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5386

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.2
(2022-03-05)

New images:
- UTM | Support for the UTM virtualizer on macOS has been added and an image is provided on our download page. It supports x86_64 natively and M1 systems via emulation, working but with performance downsides. A native aarch64 M1 image will follow soon.
- ESXi | A new VMware ESXi compatible x86_64 OVA appliance is now available for download. An ESXi-Arm variant will follow soon.
- Proxmox | A VM image for the Proxmox VM and container platform is now available for download.
- Odroid C4 | We replaced the legacy kernel image with a new mainline Linux image, built from scratch, using the methods used for the new Odroid N2(+) image.

New software:
- MicroK8s | The simplest production-grade upstream K8s. Lightweight and focused, added to DietPi as software option with ID 142. Many thanks to @silverraindog for the implementation: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5239

Removed software:
- Nvidia | Removed the dedicated proprietary Nvidia display driver install option. It can installed/uninstalled along with AMD and Intel drivers via dietpi-config display options on x86_64 systems, which is now done faster by skipping service restarts and overhead of dietpi-software around the actual package installs/uninstalls.

Changes:
- General | It is now checked in various scripts whether kernel modules for the loaded kernel are available, i.e. the directory /lib/modules/<version> which matches the kernel version reported by "uname -r", so that additional kernel modules can be loaded ondemand. This is not the case after kernel upgrades, when the previous kernel was replaced or autoremoved and a reboot outstanding to load the new kernel. In this transient situation, several system tasks and software installs can fail if they rely on loading additional kernel modules, which includes installs of container and emulation platforms, but also more trivial command calls like "ip".
- DietPi-Banner | If no DietPi or APT package update is available, the banner now informs you about an outstanding reboot to finalise a kernel upgrade.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Users will now face an additional prompt if a reboot is outstanding to finalise a kernel upgrade, with the offer to perform the reboot now. The drive manager relies on this when mounting new filesystems which require kernel drivers, and to correctly detect whether the "autofs4" module is available or not.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Reserved blocks on ext4 filesystem are now shown and can be set in MiB rather than in percent. This makes it easier to apply a reasonable value, which usually does not depend on the filesystem size but may be a fixed value to assure that root can perform maintenance or cleanup tasks.
- DietPi-Update | Users will now face an additional prompt after the update if a reboot is outstanding to finalise a kernel upgrade, with the offer to perform the reboot now. The reboot is done automatically on first boot of the DietPi system.
- DietPi-Software | The script cannot be used anymore if a reboot is outstanding to finalise a kernel upgrade. Users will face a prompt which offers to perform the reboot now. The reboot is done automatically on first boot of the DietPi system, when required, while usually this is covered by the proceeding DietPi update already.
- DietPi-Software | Roon Bridge: The service now runs as "roonbridge" service user instead of as "root". The install directory has been moved to /opt/roonbridge, the data directory to /mnt/dietpi_userdata/roonbridge and the log directory to /var/log/roonbridge, for consistency. The DietPi update does not enforce the migration, but a manual reinstall via "dietpi-software reinstall 121" applies it, while preserving all data and configs.
- DietPi-Software | Roon Extension Manager: The service now runs as "roon-extension-manager" service user instead of as "root" and the data directory has been moved to /mnt/dietpi_userdata/roon-extension-manager. The DietPi update does not enforce the migration, but a manual reinstall via "dietpi-software reinstall 86" applies it, while preserving all extensions and configs.
- DietPi-Software | Roon Server: The service now runs as "roonserver" service user instead of as "root" and logs are now done to /var/log/roonserver, i.e. the DietPi-RAMlog by default, aligning with Roon Bridge. The DietPi update does not enforce the migration, but a manual reinstall via "dietpi-software reinstall 154" applies it, while preserving all data and configs. When you do the reinstall, note that Roon remote apps will ask you to login again and unauthorise the connected Roon Server. This is however just a formal step required as of the service user change, while all your settings and libraries appear just the same.
- DietPi-Software | Docker Compose: We migrated from the Python-based v1 to v2, written in Go. Existing installs can be migrated with a manual "dietpi-software reinstall 134". Many thanks to @CommandLineN00b for making us aware of this major Docker Compose upgrade: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5034
- DietPi-Software | Chromium: It is now easier to autostart Chromium as non-root user, making use of systemd-logind and startx. The related change requires a reinstall of Chromium: dietpi-software reinstall 113
- DietPi-Software | Deluge: The web interface will now connect to the local Deluge server automatically. Many thanks to @jonyskids for doing this suggestion and @Jappe for providing the solution.
- DietPi-Software | Allo GUI: The Allo audiophile web interface received a major version update: It does caching and session storage via APCu memory cache, does not make use of the dedicated "allo" user anymore, and has undergone a bunch of updates, fixes, security hardenings and cleanups, including a database created from scratch. The migration will be done automatically with the DietPi update, which also provides further details. The source code is now hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi-AlloGUI

Fixes:
- DietPi-TimeSync | Resolved an issue where the systemd-timesyncd service was not stopped at boot as intended, when the time sync finished before DietPi-TimeSync started: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5256
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where the onboard audio selection for our new Odroid N2 image did not work. Many thanks to @Kreeblah for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5039#issuecomment-1038326411
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where via AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID dietpi.txt settings it was possible to install software on first boot which is actually not supported on the platform. Many thanks to @eyduh for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5245
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue on RPi where on repeating container platform installs, multiple "cgroup_enable=memory" entries were added to /boot/cmdline.txt. The duplicates are removed automatically on DietPi update, when present. Many thanks to @isarrider for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5225
- DietPi-Software | Apache: Resolved an issue on fresh installs where the service failed to start due to a config file syntax error. Many thanks to @Camry2731 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5248
- DietPi-Software | Nextcloud: Resolved an issue where the install on an over 2 GiB RAM system failed. Many thanks to @p4cm4n for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5251
- DietPi-Software | Folding@Home: Resolved an issue where reinstalls failed since a removed SysV service is tried to be stopped. Many thanks to @eyduh for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5255
- DietPi-Software | Bazarr: Resolved an issue where the service entered an endless restart loop because of a missing dependency. Many thanks to @alleyu2 for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Python 3: Worked around an issue on ARMv6/7 Buster systems where installing numpy or any module which depends on numpy failed: https://github.com/piwheels/packages/issues/287
- DietPi-Software | Pydio: Resolved an issue where the data directory was not writeable. Many thanks @holocronology for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5274
- DietPi-Software | Jellyfin: Resolved an issue where during install two settings failed to apply since the config file didn't exist yet. Many thanks to @echtfrank for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5279
- DietPi-Software | Firefox: Resolved a warning on startup about the missing libpci library, used to detect GPU details. Many thanks to @MDAR for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5278#issuecomment-1044381054
- DietPi-Software | X11: Resolved an issue on modern Odroid C2 and NanoPi K2 (Amlogic S905 SoC) images where the X server (desktop) failed to start. Many thanks to all users who reported and helped resolving this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5234

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5330

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.1
(2022-02-05)

SBC support:
- Odroid N2 | Support for Odroid N2(+) with modern mainline Linux images has been added, including proper boot configuration, serial console selection, HDMI and 3.5mm audio selection and more. Sadly existing images cannot be migrated, a new image is available for testing: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5039

Changes:
- DietPi-Benchmark | During RAM I/O benchmarks, the CPU governor is now changed to "performance" so that the result is not affected by possible CPU frequency scaling but the raw/max RAM I/O performance is measured. A significant effect of this has been recognised on Odroid N2 images with modern mainline kernel. Since the CPU benchmark is done first, this has no effect on its score and CPU temperature results.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Btrfs subvolume mounts are now preserved in /etc/fstab. Many thanks to @laddde for implementing this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5176
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | The Samba mount dialogues do now indicate that a hostname can be entered instead of a server IP and a shared folder path instead of a share name only.
- DietPi-Backup | A notification is not printed when rsync dry-run to obtain required disk space is starting, since this can take a while. Many thanks to @whisdol for reporting the the impression of a hanging script: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5209
- DietPi-Software | iptables is now automatically configured to use either modern nf_tables API or legacy API, depending on whether nf_tables is supported by the kernel. This is helpful for Bullseye images with older kernel versions, where iptables is by default configured to use nf_tables, which fails.
- DietPi-Software | iptables rules are now applied for IPv6 as well in all cases (for VPN servers, WiFi and Tor hotspots) via ip6tables. This does not depend on whether IPv6 is actually enabled for interfaces, but enables general IPv6 support for affected software options. Many thanks to @vielka442 for reporting missing IPv6 support for Tor Hotspot: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5038
- DietPi-Software | Jellyfin: For new installs, the default web interface port has been changed from 8096 to 8097 to resolve a port conflict with Emby.
- DietPi-Software | Docker/K3s: The memory cgroup is now enabled as well on RPi and our new Odroid N2 image, when Docker or K3s is installed, to allow container memory usage monitoring. Many thanks to @isarrider for this request: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5225
- DietPi-Software | Raspotify: This software option has been disabled on Debian Buster systems but enabled for ARMv8 and x86_64 systems, to match the current state of the official Raspotify APT repository.

Fixes:
- DietPi-Services | Resolved an issue where service edits and process tool settings were not effective as they were stored to the wrong file path. Many thanks to @TopFord and @MicDG for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | Resolved an issue where Certbot failed on fresh Apache installs since the 000-default.conf vhost by default does not contain any directive anymore. The ServerName directive with the entered domain name is now added to 000-default.conf instead of apache2.conf, with the benefit that it overrides the global ServerName directive in dietpi.conf, which uses the local IP address only.
- DietPi-Software/DietPi-AutoStart | Chromium: Resolved an issue where the Chromium kiosk autostart option failed on all non-RPi systems.
- DietPi-Software | Roon Extension Manager: It has been disabled for ARMv6 RPi systems where it cannot run currently. Many thanks to @JanKoudijs for applying this fix: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5231
- DietPi-Software | FuguHub: Resolved an issue where the uninstall failed as the service was not stopped and removed as expected, before attempting to remove the service user.
- DietPi-Software | PHP: Resolved an issue where the PATH variable was not available for PHP applications with Lighttpd and Nginx webservers. It is now set to the static value "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin", the default PATH excluding super user executables "sbin". Many thanks to @shanew1694 for reporting a related issue with rTorrent: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5161#issuecomment-1013381362
- DietPi-Software | MineOS: Resolved an issue where the install failed on Bullseye: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5181
- DietPi-Software | Cuberite: Resolved an issue where the server failed to start on ARMv8 systems: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5180
- DietPi-Software | MATE: Resolved an issue where the install failed when LXDE is installed already. Many thanks to @n0valis for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5214
- DietPi-Software | Ampache: Resolved an issue on Bullseye systems where Ampache v5 installs/reinstalls did not work because of a changed webroot directory: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5205
- DietPi-Software | OpenBazaar: Since the original project has been taken down, we migrated to a fork which keeps up the marketplace for the community: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5213
- DietPi-Software | X11: Resolved an issue where VMs without KMS/DRM support failed to start the X server, e.g. Hyper-V. The classic framebuffer DDX is now installed when no KMS/DRM support is detected on VMs.
- DietPi-Software | Box86/Box64: Resolved an issue where the install failed when a kernel upgrade has just been done so that the "binfmt_misc" kernel module cannot be found for the loaded kernel.
- DietPi-Software | RPi-Monitor: Resolved an issue where the CPU temperature was not shown. Many thanks to @KamikazeePL for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Resolved an issue with the latest Home Assistant version where restarting it via web interface made it remaining stopped. The fix is applied to all instances on DietPi update. Many thanks to @jchh for reporting this issue.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5229

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.0
(2022-01-08)

Stretch support:
- Support for Debian Stretch has now been removed, which allowed us to do a major code cleanup and migrate to some newer methods in different areas which are only available on Buster and above.

Changes:
- Network | For new images, the default DHCP timeout is not reduced to 10 seconds anymore. This could have been too short, in which case network targets of the boot sequence are reached before an IP has been actually assigned. Especially in case of AUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED=1 this could have lead to connection test timeouts and hence abortion of the automated first run setup. Many thanks to @jpeg2600 for reporting such a case: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5143
- DietPi-Config | When configuring a first WiFi slot via scanning for SSIDs, the WiFi adapter is now not brought up via "ifup" but "ip l dev wlanX up". This way no DHCP and WPA client starts are triggered, which are doomed to fail when the WiFi adapter is not connected to any access point yet. Especially in case of the default 60 seconds DHCP timeout, this would otherwise cause an unnecessary long delay.
- DietPi-Dashboard | Added an option to view multiple dashboard nodes from one frontend web interface. Related to this, the backend can now be installed only, reducing memory usage and making it impossible to manually access the node outside of the backend API.
- DietPi-Print_large | This new script has been added which can be executed or sourced from /boot/dietpi/func/dietpi-print_large to print the string passed via first argument in large figlet style fonts. It currently only supports the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, dot and dash, i.e. those commonly allowed in hostnames.
- DietPi-Banner | Added an option to print the system's hostname in large figlet style fonts, right below the banner header. In case it is enabled as well, the regular/small hostname line will then be skipped. Many thanks to @matellis for implementing this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5113
- DietPi-Software | Mono: "mono-complete" won't be installed anymore but only "mono-devel" instead. This skips the XSP4 webserver service, which listens on port 8084 by default where it conflicts with File Browser. This only affects new instals. You can manually apply this change via "apt-mark manual mono-devel && apt --autoremove purge mono-complete". Many thanks to @jaguar489 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5093
- DietPi-Software | FuguHub: The outdated official installer has been replaced with a fully automated own setup, removing the obsolete or even harmful interactive dialogues. On fresh installs, an admin account "dietpi" with global software password is created as well.
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: Installation is now done via official APT repository, which means quicker install compared to compiling from source, fewer dependencies and easier updates via "apt upgrade": https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5115
- DietPi-Software | Airsonic: Since the project has been archived by its maintainer and suffers from the critical Log4Shell security vulnerability, we moved to the advertised fork "Airsonic-Advanced" which also enables compatibility with Java 17 and hence Debian Bullseye. Airsonic will be reinstalled as part of the DietPi update to apply the migration. All data and settings will be preserved and migrated automatically.

Fixes:
- Raspberry Pi | Resolved an issue where unintentionally the turbo mode was enabled. This got backported to v7.9, to our existing RPi images and via live patch. Many thanks to @ayo-x and @whyisthisbroken for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5088
- DietPi-FS_partition_resize | Resolved an issue where in some cases the boot partition failed to mount on first boot since after the partition resize the system in some cases didn't get sufficient time to fully apply the change before continuing with the boot mount attempt. Many thanks to @Mausy5043 and @sistemicorp for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5006
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where on Raspberry Pi, when the full KMS display driver is used, the sound card selection could have been falsely applied. With full KMS enabled, for each HDMI port an additional HDMI sound card appears (replacing the regular firmware HDMI sound device), even when no HDMI device is attached and with onboard audio disabled. This lead to an incrementation of external sound card indices. The appearance of the KMS HDMI sound cards is now aligned with the onboard firmware HDMI sound cards, i.e. if not onboard "auto" or HDMI is selected in dietpi-config, now the KMS HDMI sound devices are disabled as well, making use of the "noaudio" device tree overlay parameter.
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where on first boot, choice and preference menu selections triggered an error as the install state file did not exist yet. Many thanks to @bsheeres for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5080
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where the deprecated AUTO_SETUP_FILE_SERVER_INDEX dietpi.txt option was applied inverted. "-1" should have installed ProFTPD and "-2" Samba, while it was done the opposite way. However, note that this setting is not present on current images and deprecated. Use AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID instead to mark any one or multiple file servers for automatic install. Many thanks to @bsheeres for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5081
- DietPi-Software | Browsers: On the ARMv6 Raspberry Pi models Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero (1) since Bullseye, Chromium and Firefox fail to start due to hardware and build limitations which are outside of our control. Since those are currently the only two browser available from dietpi-software, they have been disabled together with the browser preference menu for those systems, until we find and implement a good additional compatible browser. Further info: https://github.com/RPi-Distro/chromium/issues/21
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: Resolved an issue where subsequent Kodi reinstalls created duplicates of the CMA parameter for the KMS overlay setting in config.txt. The duplicates are patched out during DietPi update.
- DietPi-Software | Docker: Resolved an issue where the install was aborted due to an incorrect check for missing kernel modules. Many thanks to @dragonandy for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5061
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Resolved an issue where the teleporter import log was not shown but denied by the X-Frame-Options header: https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/unable-to-restore-teleporter-backup-fresh-install-no-funky-changes-made/51573
- DietPi-Software | Blynk Server: Resolved an issue on ARMv6 RPi models where the install failed as the latest Blynk Server release does not contain a Java 8 build. Since the older Java 8 build does not contain a native Log4Shell vulnerability mitigation, it is added server-wise on these systems.
- DietPi-Software | Mycroft AI: Resolved an issue on Bullseye (and above) systems where "mycroft-cli-client" command fails with a permissions issue, even as root user. Many thanks to @berndverhofstadt for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5100
- DietPi-Software | Nukkit: Resolved an issue where the install failed due to a changed download URL. The Jenkins instance has moved to ci.opencollab.dev, where also the Geyser and Floodgate projects are hosted.
- DietPi-Software | FuguHub: Resolved an issue where the uninstall failed as the process was not stopped as intended. Many thanks to @kd9352 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5058
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: Resolved an issue where the installation failed due to an updated dependency. Many thanks to @supersexy for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5115
- DietPi-Software | Python 3: Worked around an issue where the pip reinstall failed. Many thanks to @hueppinr for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5117
- DietPi-Software | Unbound: Resolved an issue where the "unbound-resolvconf" service applied localhost automatically as local nameserver, if the "resolvconf" package was installed. Since often Unbound is installed in combination with Pi-hole or AdGuard Home, and those are usually used by network clients only, not the server itself, "unbound-resolvconf" is disabled now on Unbound installs. If Unbound is wanted as local resolver as well, it should be explicitly configured, e.g. via dietpi-config network options. Many thanks to @Ianszh for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5133
- DietPi-Software | Mosquitto: Applied a workaround on ARMv6 where the latest Mosquitto packages from the official APT repository are not ARMv6-compatible. Many thanks to @thomasmockridge for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5140

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5146

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v7.9
(2021-12-11)

Stretch support:
- This is the last DietPi release with support for Debian Stretch. Next release will be DietPi v8.0 which requires Debian Buster or newer. Read our article about why we need to make this move and how you can easily upgrade your system to Debian Buster and even further to current stable Debian Bullseye: https://dietpi.com/blog/?p=1001

Changes:
- Raspberry Pi | Since Bullseye, some media software titles, most importantly FFmpeg and those which make use of FFmpeg libraries compiled for Raspberry Pi firmware (Kodi, Jellyfin, Chromium), utilise the Raspberry Pi V4L2 codec drivers. Those were previously enabled/disabled with the RPi camera module switch in dietpi-config. The hardware codec drivers have now become an own CLI command and menu switch in the dietpi-config display options and are enabled automatically when one of the mentioned software titles is installed or reinstalled on Bullseye (or above).
- DietPi-Dashboard | On fresh installs, password protection is now enabled by default, using the global software password. You can apply or change this manually by following the instructions in our documentation: https://dietpi.com/docs/software/system_stats/#dietpi-dashboard
- DietPi-Dashboard | The default TCP network port has been changed from 8088 to 5252 to resolve a port conflict with InfluxDB. This does not affect existing installs, but you will be asked whether to apply this change during DietPi update. Many thanks to @blablazzz for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4966
- DietPi-Backup | A backup archive with a selectable amount of backups to keep can be created now. Backups are rotated automatically and if the maximum amount has been reached, the oldest backup is used as basis for the incremental new backup sync, to reduce writes and increase speed. Many thanks to @johnvick and many others for requesting this feature.
- DietPi-Backup | Backups can now be stored outside of /mnt into any directory or mount point as long as the filesystem supports symlinks and UNIX permissions.
- DietPi-Software | The file server choice menu has been removed. Most file servers can run concurrently, hence it is not required to remove e.g. a Samba server to install an FTP server, so that a dedicated menu lost its reason. File servers can be selected the regular way via "Browse/Search Software" menus or CLI. The related dietpi.txt setting has been removed for new images as well, but it will still be respected when present. For an automated install with new images, use the "AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID" setting instead.
- DietPi-Software | SABnzbd: For fresh installs, file logging has been disabled in favour of journal logging. All service and process logs can hence now be reviewed via: journalctl -u sabnzbd
- DietPi-Software | Apache: Fresh installs and reinstalls will be configured with PHP-FPM instead of mod_php. As a requirement, the event MPM is used instead of prefork. This reduces memory usage and increases access performance significantly on concurrent requests, as the Apache parent process does not need to fork a new child process for every single process. We further optimised it by spawning a single static child process only while handling concurrent requests by a sufficient amount of process threads. This allows Apache to share memory efficiently and makes it quite lightweight. There are no downsides known when using a single process only, compared to multiple processes with less threads each. Related StackExchange questions: https://superuser.com/questions/1611015/apache2-mpm-event-more-threads-vs-more-processes
- DietPi-Software | Apache: Our default/base configuration is now added as separate file, so that the main apache2.conf is not touched anymore. Furthermore the default vhost is now pre-created before the package install, so that it can be skipped on a reinstall to not overwrite user customisations. These in combination allow for a safe and clean reinstall without breaking any changes done by the admin, with the little exception that the webroot is set to /var/www which is required for all our software options which make use of an external webserver.
- DietPi-Software | Apache: Our new default config provides maximum privacy settings and security headers. It is trivial to override these with own configurations, on vhost or directory level.
- DietPi-Software | Apache: Logging is now done to journal (journalctl -u apache2) by default and the ServerName directive added with the local IP, to mute related startup warnings. This may imply access and CORS failures when applications check for the server name as allowed hostname but a different external IPs/hostnames was used for access. In such case generally applications provide a way to define a list of permitted hostnames. Without a server name set, usually webserver simply apply the HTTP_HOST header, which bypasses every related check. Apache, according to the logged warning, seems to use 127.0.1.1 then.
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: On Raspberry Pi Bullseye systems, the new official Raspberry Pi repository build for Kodi 19.3 is now installed. You can apply the upgrade manually by reinstalling Kodi: dietpi-software reinstall 31
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: The addon repository is now installed by default with all Kodi installs, which previously was the case only on RPi and Odroids. When currently missing, it can be manually installed: apt install kodi-repository-kodi
- DietPi-Software | Gitea: The service runs now as dedicated user "gitea" with its home directory "/mnt/dietpi_userdata/gitea" to allow easy transfer and usage of SSH keys for remote access. This applies to newly installed or reinstalled Gitea instances. Many thanks to @LilTrublMakr for reporting the related limitation with the previously used "dietpi" user: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4620
- DietPi-Software | Chromium: On Raspberry Pi, the chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra package is now installed together with Chromium, which adds additional codecs for patented video/audio formats. Many thanks to @Krawei for identifying this Chromium video playback enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5013
- DietPi-Software | rTorrent: By default on fresh installs, rTorrent now listens on TCP port 49164 for incoming BitTorrent connections. Aside of DHT, listening for incoming connections was completely disabled before, which lead to slow or no peer connections, depending on the tracker used. Many thanks to @Camry2731 for reporting this inconsistency with our other BitTorrent server options.

Fixes:
- Raspberry Pi | Resolved an issue in our images where on first boot two serial login consoles on the generic symlinked and actual serial devices could have been started. This doubled inputs and in turn broke successful username and password login via serial console on first boot. Many thanks to @ad7718 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5014
- DietPi-Backup | Resolved an issue where backup and restore failed if a non-default backup location is used, as a wrong log file path was used. This is a v7.8 regression. Many thanks to @Malinka for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where enabling the "odroid-lcd35" LCD panel on Odroids failed as SPI is enabled by default, blocking the same GPIO ports. Many thanks to @MarcProux for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4154
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where the network adapter menu did not show the static DNS server(s) effetively applied at first boot based on dietpi.txt settings. Many thanks to @nils-trubkin for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5054
- DietPi-Software | Resolved a v7.8 regression where ReadyMedia, Deluge, Sonarr and Jellyfin installs failed with an error on "usermod", since the services were not stopped first. This has been loved via live patches for v7.8 as well.
- DietPi-Software | Transmission: Resolved a v7.8 regression where on fresh installs the intended configuration was not deployed. Many thanks to @kannz and @alessandro.psrt for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | SABnzbd: Resolved an issue where installs failed on ARMv6 and ARMv7 Stretch systems. Many thanks to @bensp for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4997
- DietPi-Software | Deluge: Worked around an issue on Raspberry Pi ARMv6 userland systems where the service failed to start. Deluge has hence been re-enabled for this systems. Many thanks to @themagicbullet for providing the workaround: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4944
- DietPi-Software | UnRAR: Resolved an issue on Raspberry Pi 1 an Zero (1) where an incompatible "unrar" binary was installed. "unrar-free" from Raspbian is installed now on these models, but note that it does not fully support all RAR formats and may hence fail to extract archives in some cases.
- DietPi-Software | rTorrent: Resolved an issue where with Apache webserver the /RPC2 proxy to the rTorrent UNIX socket did not work due to invalid syntax. Many thanks to @Camry2731 for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | RealVNC: Updated/fixed the workaround for a failing first start of RealVNC due to a cleared password file. Many thanks to @xmicky for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5050

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5053

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v7.8
(2021-11-13)

New SBC support:
- Radxa Zero | Initial support for this Raspberry Pi Zero form factored (but way more powerful) SBC has been added to DietPi with the hardware ID 74. Many thanks to @almirus and @dhry for helping with testing and debugging an early image: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4831
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W | Initial support for this Raspberry Pi Zero/Zero W successor has been added, using hardware ID 3 for now (shared with RPi 3/3+), including overclocking profiles. Many thanks to @CassTG for providing early hardware information and doing intensive overclocking tests.

Removed SBC support:
- Odroid N1 | There is not a single reported DietPi Odroid N1 system, which makes sense as this model was never really released. Only a small number of developer samples are floating around, not worth to keep maintaining an image and dedicated code. If there are unreported Odroid N1 DietPi systems out there, they will be automatically migrated to the Generic Rockchip RK3399 device ID on DietPi update.

New software:
- DietPi-Dashboard | Thanks to the great work of @ravenclaw900, we are proud to announce our own official DietPi web interface for monitoring and managing your DietPi system using your web browser. It is still in beta phase as we test and gradually implement more features. We would be happy if you would try it out via "dietpi-software install 200" and give us feedback: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/448

Removed software:
- Subsonic | Since it is not developed anymore and due to shared library dependencies only compatible with Debian Stretch, we removed Subsonic from DietPi-Software. With Airsonic-Advanced, we'll provide a well maintained and Bullseye-compatible alternative soon. If you currently have Subsonic installed, it will remain. If you want to uninstall it, follow the instructions here: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4895
- emonHub | Since we do not have a single reported installation, we removed emonHub from DietPi-Software. If you currently have emonHub installed, it will remain. If you want to keep using and updating it, have a look at the official repository at https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonhub. If you want to uninstall it, follow the instructions here: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4895

Changes:
- DietPi-Config | Overclocking profiles for most Raspberry Pi models have been updated to match the effective 100 MHz ARM/CPU frequency steps used by current firmware. Also an energy saving profile has been added to some models, which reduces minimum and maximum voltage a little, reducing energy consumption and heat emission a little on idle and on load.
- DietPi-Config | The option to prefer IPv4 connections when IPv6 is enabled has been removed: This only worked for APT and wget, while e.g. cURL and ping were never affected by this setting, which meant an inconsistent behaviour. If one faces issues with IPv6 enabled, it should be simply disabled instead of preferring/forcing IPv4 only for specific tools.
- DietPi-Backup | A feature has been added to enable daily system backup via cron job. Many thanks to @Lycidias93 for suggesting this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3871
- DietPi-Backup | Rsync/transfer logs are now done to "dietpi-backup.log" inside of the backup directory. This way they remain persistent even if DietPi-RAMlog is enabled and can be reviewed at a later time. This is helpful especially when daily backups via cron job are enabled, where the log obviously is not presented directly when the backup finished. A related option to review the last transfer log has been added to the dietpi-backup main menu. The old log file /var/log/dietpi-backup.log is moved to the new location if any backup exists during next DietPi update.
- DietPi-Backup | When using an NFS mount as backup target, it is now verified that the NFS share supports UNIX permissions to prevent the creation of a broken system backup in the first place.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | When transferring the DietPi user data to a different drive, it is now checked whether the target location is located within a supported filesystem type, one with native symlink and UNIX permission support. The same is done when using the CLI script /boot/dietpi/func/dietpi-set_userdata.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Transferring the root filesystem is now supported on Odroid C4/HC4 models.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | The option to transfer the root filesystem is now shown as well when the drive does not contain any filesystem. The process implies formatting with a supported filesystem anyway which makes the condition obsolete. Also it is not needed anymore to unmount the filesystem manually first, as this is done automatically before formatting. In the related format menu, only supported filesystems are listed, i.e. ext4 and additionally F2FS on Raspberry Pi. The input box to enter a custom mount point is omitted as it is only temporarily used until the root filesystem transfer has finished. The swap file is not disabled anymore as it can be copied and reused as is on the new root filesystem without issues.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | When transferring the root filesystem, further checks are performed: There needs to be a dedicated boot partition (required on Raspberry Pi and default on our current Odroid images), as this is what the transfer steps expect and the only reason for moving only the root filesystem instead of cloning the whole drive or flashing the DietPi image to an external drive in the first place. The expected boot/kernel configuration files need to be present so that the kernel can be instructed to mount the new root filesystem. The DietPi user data must not currently be located at the target partition as it would be formatted and all data hence lost.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | On ext4 filesystems, the reserved blocks percentage is now shown and can be changed as well if the drive is not currently mounted.
- DietPi-RAMlog | The /var/log directory structure is now synced to the persistent disk storage after software installs and via daily cron job to prevent missing logs files or directories in case of unclean shutdowns, which usually lead to failing service startups.
- DietPi-Software | Roon Server: Added support for the new .NET core based version, released on November 3rd, which is expected to have improved performance compared to the old Mono based version. To resolve an old issue with our Roon Server implementation (see below), a reinstall is done during the DietPi update, which pulls in the .NET core dependencies as well. But this will NOT update the Roon Server version to prevent issues with potentially required migration steps. After updating DietPi, use Roon's internal updater to benefit from the new version.

Fixes:
- Raspberry Pi | Worked around an issue on Raspberry Pi ARMv6/7 Bullseye systems where some software failed to start, e.g. RealVNC, if binaries were compiled against an older libraspberrypi0 version with different shared library names.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where resizing F2FS filesystems failed when currently mounted. Contradicting the docs and error output, mounting the filesystem read-only is not sufficient, but it needs to be unmounted instead, which is now done automatically before the resize and remounted afterwards.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where resizing ext4 filesystems could have failed when not currently mounted. Especially if the drive is newly attached, a full fsck needs to be done once before it can be resized. This is now done automatically, allowing to resolve filesystem errors interactively, before resizing an offline ext4 filesystem.
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where Raspberry Pi 4 overclocking profiles were offered on Raspberry Pi 400. A new set of profiles have now been added dedicated for the Raspberry Pi 400.
- DietPi-Software | Icecast: Resolved an issue where a new install failed due to an attempted operation on a non-existing file. Many thanks to @killtux for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4858
- DietPi-Software | Logitech Media Server: Resolved an issue where the uninstall failed as the package postinst script tried to remove the service user before the service was stopped.
- DietPi-Software | Roon Server: Resolved an issue where the internal updater purged all Roon Server data and configs, since the data directory was located within the install directory. Roon Server will now be installed to /opt/roonserver while the data directory remains at /mnt/dietpi_userdata/roonserver. This change will be applied via DietPi update as well, your data and configs will remain untouched. Many thanks to @JanKoudijs for reporting this issue and providing a solution: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4897
- DietPi-Software | LXDE: Resolved an issue where on some cases on first desktop start, desktop icons were missing and another issue on Bullseye systems, where a "No session for pid" error message popped up on desktop start. Many thanks to @kerryland for reporting these issues: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4914
- DietPi-Software | LXDE: Resolved an issue where the Firefox browser panel icon was present even if no Firefox was installed. In this case now either Chromium or the text editor is added as replacement.
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Resolved an issue where the install failed on ARMv6/ARMv7 Bullseye systems.
- DietPi-Software | Tor Relay: This software option has been disabled on Stretch. The Tor package shipped by the Debian Stretch repository is too old to support required protocols of the Tor network, when running a relay. Many thanks to @cptechnik for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4925
- DietPi-Software | Deluge: Resolved an issue where on fresh installs the services failed due to an invalid config file syntax. Many thanks to @bookedirl for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Deluge: As the package from Raspbian Bullseye currently fails, we needed to disable Deluge for Raspberry Pi systems with ARMv6 Bullseye image. The bug has been reported to the Raspbian maintainers and we hope for a fix until next DietPi release: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4944
- DietPi-Software | Lighttpd: Resolved an issue where reinstalls on a Bullseye system with DietPi-LetsEncrypt used, erroneously enabled an SSL configuration which could prevent the service start.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4951

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v7.7
(2021-10-16)

Removed software:
- CouchPotato | Sadly, the CouchPotato project is not maintained anymore and has been abandoned. In turn we removed it from DietPi. The instance installed on your system will remain, but it cannot be installed, reinstalled or uninstalled anymore. We recommend to migrate to an alternative project, like Radarr, which can be found in DietPi-Software was well. Manual CouchPotato uninstall instructions: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4323#issuecomment-927128724

Changes:
- General | The /boot/dietpi/func/obtain_network_details script has been removed, including the related /run/dietpi/.network file to obtain network details. All uses of these files have been replaced with the new DietPi-Globals G_GET_NET function (see below).
- DietPi-Globals | A new global function G_GET_NET has been added to print network interface details. Most importantly it prints info for the main interface, by following the priorities of /boot/dietpi/func/obtain_network_details: default gateway => state UP => IP assigned, but allows to additionally filter by IP family, type, interface name or print the default gateway explicitly. It aims to be a replacement for /boot/dietpi/func/obtain_network_details with more flexibility and to allow deriving always up-to-date interface info instead of depending on the correctness of a cache file.
- DietPi-Globals | G_GET_WAN_IP: We use our own GEO IP service now to show the systems WAN IP and location in the DietPi banner and DietPi-VPN. When Pi-hole was used, with a previous update, "freegeoip.app" was added to Pi-hole's whitelist, which now is not required anymore. You may hence remove that entry from the whitelist.
- DietPi-Globals | The global functions G_DEV_1 and G_DEV_BENCH have been removed, which did exist for testing and development only but are not used in our current workflows.
- DietPi-TimeSync | Use the same flag file that systemd-timesyncd itself uses since Buster, to skip an additional service restart and sync when it was done already.
- DietPi-TimeSync | When our oneshot modes (boot only, hourly, daily) are selected, systemd-timesyncd is now "enabled" to be started by systemd earlier at boot, instead of on our script call. Especially since both now share the same flag file (on Buster and above), this has a chance to prevent an additional service restart if the time sync has finished already when PostBoot is reached.
- DietPi-Boot | This script and service has been removed: Waiting for network is now done via DietPi-PostBoot "After=network-online.target", time sync is done in DietPi-PostBoot, but in background (mostly not required for service starts) and pre-installed image stage handling is as well done in PostBoot now.
- DietPi-Update | A network connection and time sync check is now done before checking for updates, similar to how DietPi-Software does it on installs.
- DietPi-Login | The DietPi banner on login won't be shown anymore if ~/.hushlogin exists, which is a common method to prevent the shell from printing /etc/motd on login and should hence be respected for the DietPi banner as well. Many thanks to @dnknth for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4786
- DietPi-JustBoom | Added the ability to enforce an output channel count, or to not enforce an audio format value to preserve the input stream format or leave conversion up to ALSA, which is now the default when resetting settings. Similarly, the audio output buffer can now be unset to keep the MPD default. Generally, if not required for a specific reason, it is recommended to not convert the audio stream and keep these settings unchanged/default.
- DietPi-Software | Deluge: Logging is not done to /var/log/deluged/ anymore but to journal instead, accessible via "journalctl -u deluged -u deluge-web". This change only affects new installs and reinstalls of Deluge.
- DietPi-Software | Deluge: On fresh installs, the web interface is now accessible as expected with the chosen global software password, stored hashed with a fresh random salt. Previously the password was hardcoded to "dietpi".
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: On Debian Bullseye, with Kodi 19, GBM support is present by default, which means that Kodi can be started without a wrapping X server. This is now done by default when starting Kodi outside of a desktop session, including the dietpi-autostart option. This also means that an X server is not installed anymore as a dependency of Kodi, but only as a dependency of a desktop environment.
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: It can now be installed on all devices. In some cases, video playback performance may be bad, depending on the GPU, whether good drivers are available, and on the video quality, of course. However, it should be our users who evaluate whether it's sufficient or not, instead of us. With Debian Bullseye, new Mesa drivers and Kodi 19 started via GBM, performance should be much better than it was with older Debian/package versions.
- DietPi-Software | File Browser: The default network port has been changed to 8084 to resolve a conflict with HTPC Manager. This only affects new File Browser installs. Many thanks to @KamikazeePL for reporting this issue.

Fixes:
- General | Since the Armbian repository router does not reliably preserves HTTPS on redirects yet, APT by times fails when detecting a downgrade from HTTPS to HTTP. We hence change the armbian.list to use plain HTTP until the issues with the router have been resolved.
- General | Worked around an issue on Debian Stretch where "systemctl enable/disable --now" does not start/stop the service in certain circumstances. This is solved within our error handler "G_EXEC", hence when manually calling systemctl you may still face this: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4815
- General | Applied a workaround on Bullseye systems with older Linux versions (v4.14 and below) which do not sufficiently support the new "unified cgroup hierarchy" (a.k.a. cgroups-v2). Since the newer systemd tries to use it automatically, Docker and similar software which make use of cgroups fail. For devices with known boot configuration file, the kernel command line arguments are applied to force the legacy cgroups hierarchy usage.
- DietPi-Backup | Resolved an issue where clearing the PATH cache via "hash" command did not work as of a wrong command line argument: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4800
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | Resolved an issue where the script failed when ownCloud or Nextcloud were installed. Many thanks to @billouetaudrey for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4752
- DietPi-JustBoom | Resolved an issue where applying some MPD settings did not work. Many thanks to @elevader for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where the WiFi connection state could have been obtained falsely as accidentally the Ethernet interface index was used to derive it.
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on NanoPi NEO (and likely other Allwinner H3 SBCs) where selecting a sound card failed as an invalid control was tried to be set. Many thanks to @VS-X for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4833
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where software services failed with a cryptic error message, when an expected directory was not present. This was especially reported with Sonarr and Radarr, if their log directory was missing for some reason. When directories are missing, which are explicitly listed to be read-writeable within the systemd service, systemd prints "Failed at step NAMESPACE spawning", while Sonarr and Radarr themselves would print a clearer error message about the missing log directory. Many thanks to @stevewitz for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Lighttpd: Resolved an issue where the upgrade from Buster to Bullseye, following our guide, fails if HTTPS was enabled via DietPi-LetsEncrypt before. Many thanks to @fhals for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: Resolved an issue on RPi ARMv8/64-bit systems where Kodi fails to start when it was installed without a desktop. Many thanks to @Klola for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Deluge: Resolved an issue on Bullseye where the web interface service did not start as a new command line flag "-d" is required to keep it in foreground. Many thanks to @quyentruong for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4785
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: The Python version compiled with Home Assistant has been bumped to v3.9.7, which resolves and issue with installs on 32-bit ARM systems. Many thanks to @Przemek for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4372#issuecomment-936656595
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Resolved an issue where Home Assistant did not start on ARM systems due to newly required runtime libraries.
- DietPi-Software | Chromium: Resolved an issue where the autostart option didn't work if Chromium was installed without a desktop. Many thanks to @jowelboy for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Chromium: Resolved an issue on RPi where starting Chromium failed if no desktop was installed, due to a missing dependency. Many thanks to @Loader23 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4782
- DietPi-Software | X11: Resolved an issue with Odroid N2 and C4 models where the installation failed because of a typo. Many thanks to @wiml for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4830
- DietPi-Software | Airsonic: Since the project has been archived and does not support Java 17, it has been disabled on Bullseye. We're watching a fork (https://github.com/airsonic-advanced/airsonic-advanced) which is actively developed and which is Java 17 compatible. We currently still face some major issues so that we needed to postpone the migration. Many thanks to @Andaloup for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4847
- DietPi-Software | FreshRSS: Resolved an issue where on reinstalls nested /opt/FreshRSS/FreshRSS-master and /opt/FreshRSS/p/p were created. Since FreshRSS has an internal updater, reinstalls won't download and install the new version as long as /opt/FreshRSS is present already. The nested directory and link is removed on next DietPi update, when present. Many thanks to @kinoushe for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4775

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4840

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v7.6
(2021-09-18)

Changes:
- General | Initial detection and support for Debian 12 Bookworm (the new "testing" version) has been added to DietPi. Everyone is invited to upgrade to Bookworm to stay on bleeding edge. Just note that due to continued breaking changes coming with package upgrades, some features and software installs are broken or will break. We are happy to receive your bug report then, to have necessary changes implemented in DietPi as fast as breaking changes in Bookworm happen, until it becomes the new stable Debian release, expected in summer 2023.
- DietPi-FS_partition_resize | On first boot, DietPi automatically expands the root partition and filesystem to cover the full disk size. In some circumstances, e.g. on older kernel versions, it may happen that the two used commands "partprobe" and "partx -u" fail to inform the kernel about the changed partition table and hence the filesystem is not expanded. In such case, the system is now rebooted automatically once to assure that the new partition table is loaded and the filesystem is then expanded. This change affects only new images with contain DietPi v7.6 already, since this expansion is done before DietPi updates itself. Many thanks to @Dtrieb for reporting a case where the filesystem expansion failed: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4582
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Native Linux exFAT support is now detected and respected by skipping the obsolete FUSE driver install in case. Additionally the new "exfatprogs" are installed on Bullseye, written and implemented with Debian Bullseye along with the native Linux exFAT implementation.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | exFAT mounts now have 775 mode and are owned by the "dietpi" group, if it was not manually removed. By default, when the FUSE driver is used, mounts have 777 mode so that all users have full access, which isn't optimal for security reasons. With native Linux exFAT support mounts have 755 mode by default, so that DietPi-Software's download and media software implementations don't have write access. "775 root:dietpi" is a good compromise if the "dietpi" group exists, matching the permissions for content directories in /mnt/dietpi_userdata. Many thanks to @K92Pi for reporting a related issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4680
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Added support for moving the root filesystem to a different drive on Odroid N2.
- DietPi-AutoStart | A new autostart option "Custom script (foreground, with autologin)" has been added, which executes the custom script "/var/lib/dietpi/dietpi-autostart/custom.sh" after being logged in with the chosen user automatically, in foreground on the main screen. To have it more reasonably separated, the previous custom script option has been changed to "Custom script (background, no autologin)", which is executed via systemd service, independently of any login state like before, but does not print to foreground console anymore. Instead output goes to journal (journalctl -u dietpi-autostart_custom) like most other systemd services do. The foreground mode now behaves like most other foreground/GUI autostart options, launches after autologin at the main screen (TTY1) and, if it's a long running process, it can be cancelled via CTRL+C, just like CAVA or DietPi-CloudShell. If one wants to run a custom script in foreground on the main screen before/independent of a login, placing it into /var/lib/dietpi/postboot.d/ is another option. All contained scripts are executed at the end of the boot sequence as root user on the main screen, without any manual login required. Many thanks to @scorgn for implementing this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4634
- DietPi-Software | TigerVNC: Instead of x11vnc, TigerVNC's own scraping server is now used for shared desktop mode, which is a bit lighter and shares a lot of libraries with the TigerVNC standalone server package.
- DietPi-Software | RealVNC: Having desktop autologin enabled does not force the shared desktop VNC mode anymore. Furthermore our "vncserver.service" does not call RealVNC's "vncserver-x11-serviced.service" for the shared desktop mode, but instead the actual vncserver-x11 executable is called directly. This has some benefits, e.g. it allows to use our service for a virtual desktop while using RealVNC's service to allow connections to the shared local desktop independently. Many thanks to @K92Pi for bringing this idea to us: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4672
- DietPi-Software | RealVNC: The VNC server is now started with "VncAuth" authentication by default, which allows any VNC viewer to connect, not just RealVNC's ones. Use "vncpasswd" to change the password, which is now independent of the UNIX user passwords. It defaults to the global software password on a fresh install.
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Due to changes in DietPi v7.5, enabling Amiberry fast boot won't change the TTY for boot/kernel on Raspberry Pi anymore, as they do not directly interfere with Amiberry screen output anymore. But due to this change, during screen mode changes, the raw console output is visible for a short time, which breaks the Amiga feeling. To address the issue, instead of changing the kernel command line (cmdline), Amiberry will now switch to a different expectedly empty TTY on startup and switch back to the main TTY when being stopped, including the case of failure. As this is achieved with the Amiberry service itself, the Amiberry standard boot option benefits from it as well, as well as manual "systemctl start amiberry" calls, all the same way, and it is not limited to the Raspberry Pi, as the previous TTY change was. Many thanks to @zompiexx for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4692
- DietPi-Software | MPD: The service file and default mpd.conf are not overwritten anymore (from Buster on), but instead the required changes are added to the default, shipped with the Debian package. This resolves some error messages on MPD startup on Bullseye and leaves most custom changes untouched on a reinstall. Furthermore, by default MPD now logs to journal, accessible via "journalctl -u mpd". Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting the MPD startup errors: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4690
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: Our Raspberry Pi accelerated Kodi package is now installed on ARMv7 RPi systems as well.

New Software:
- Box64 | This x86_64 user space emulator allows you to run x86_64 binaries on an ARMv8/arm64 system. It works very similar to Box86, hence is able to use arm64 shared libraries with the x86_64 binaries, so that often no additional libraries need to be installed. Thanks to binfmt, it is invoked automatically if an x86_64 binary is tried to be executed. Many thanks to @ravenclaw900 for implementing this software title: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4625
- File Browser | Access and manage your data from anywhere via browser with this lightweight remote file manager. Other than ownCloud and Nextcloud, it accesses the raw data on your filesystem, based on a chosen root directory, which makes it similar to Syncthing. You can setup multiple users with their own root directory and also sharing files and directories via password-protected link is possible.
- Spotifyd | Spotifyd streams music just like the official client, but is more lightweight. It also supports the Spotify Connect protocol, which makes it show up as a device that can be controlled from the official clients. Many thanks to @ressu for implementing this software title: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4713

Fixes:
- General | Resolved an issue on ARMv7 Buster and Bullseye system, where the haveged entropy daemon crashes due to limited syscall permissions. This can lead to several issues, like hanging boot, hanging installs or services starts. Many thanks to @jg777 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4710
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Corrected false information when doing an exFAT filesystem check & repair: Until Stretch, only checking for exFAT errors is supported but not repairing them. From Buster on, both is fully supported.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where on Odroid C2 moving the root filesystem to a different drive failed. Many thanks to @yandritos for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4733
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | When enabling HTTPS redirect or HSTS and ownCloud or Nextcloud are installed, the "overwrite.cli.url" setting in the config.php is updated accordingly to contain the primary HTTPS domain. This is required for cron jobs and the occ/ncc commands to access ownCloud/Nextcloud through the webserver, as the Let's Encrypt certificate is only valid for the external domain name and not "localhost". Many thanks to @droogi for reporting a possibly related issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4353
- DietPi-Software | TigerVNC: Resolved an issue where remote connections didn't work by default on Bullseye systems, as a different configuration file is used.
- DietPi-Software | LXDE: Resolved an issue on Raspberry Pi where calling lxappearance (Customize Look and Feel) failed due to incompatible RPi desktop packages. Many thanks to @pinipon for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4687
- DietPi-Software | LXDE: Resolved an issue on Bullseye where some icon themes could not be applied due to a missing SVG library. Many thanks to @pinipon for reporting the issue and solution: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4687
- DietPi-Software | LXDE: Resolved an issue where the hotkey setup didn't work because of a missing openbox plugin. Many thanks to @pinipon for reporting the issue and solution: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4687
- DietPi-Software | Blynk: Resolved an issue where the log directory may be missing, which breaks the service start, when the userdata were migrated from one system to a new one. Many thanks to @Phil1988 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4721
- DietPi-Software | qBittorrent: Resolved an issue on Bullseye systems where login to the web interface was not possible with the global software password since the required hash algorithm has changed. Many thanks to @aftensleuk for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | ReadyMedia: Resolved an issue on Bullseye where the service does not start unless the log directory is manually created. Due to a Debian package patch, on Bullseye logs are forced to file logging again, so that /var/log/minidlna again needs to exist. Many thanks to @AnzoP for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4745

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4747

v7.5
(2021-08-21)

Changes:
- DietPi-Globals | A new global function G_GET_WAN_IP has been added to print the public IP and location info. This function is now used by DietPi-Banner and DietPi-VPN to show the public IP. It makes use of the public API at freegeoip.app, which may also be used by malware, like all public APIs, and may hence be present in public blocklists. The function checks, whether this is the case, via curl's exit code, and in case prints a meaningful error message. Many thanks to @cocoflan for reporting the a related case: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4445
- DietPi-FirstBoot | On our x86_64 BIOS images, the GRUB bootloader is configured to install itself on upgrade to the "/dev/sda" drive, which is the most commonly used system drive path and there is no way to configure a unique identifier that is assured to match the later actual system drive. When GRUB is upgraded, and the configured drive path does not exist, or GRUB has doubts that it is the correct system drive, the upgrade will fail. If GRUB installs itself to the wrong drive, the actually booted GRUB version won't match the GRUB files on the root filesystem, which can make the system unbootable. To enhance the situation, on first boot, DietPi detects the apparent system drive and changes the GRUB configuration accordingly. This will work on all our images, but note that on custom images it might be wrong: Generally it is possible to have the bootloader installed on one drive, but the root filesystem stored on a different physical drive, and we have no possibility to reliable detect this case. Many thanks to @brianbloom for reporting the issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4542
- DietPi-Software | Java: This install option has now been split into the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) and the JDK (Java Development Kit). As our Java-written software options require the JRE only, this saves over 200 MiB of additional JDK-related disk space. For developers, however, the JDK stays with the same software ID.
- DietPi-Software | Cuberite: Re-applied the official binary on ARMv6 systems (Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero). Since those did not support ARMv6 in the past, we installed an old self-hosted binary, but now the latest official one can be used. Many thanks to @tigerw for letting us know about the change: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3664#issuecomment-901261614
- DietPi-Software | Lidarr: Where supported (on all platforms but Raspberry Pi 1/Zero), the .NET core build build is now installed, which makes the dedicated Mono runtime obsolete and should generally perform better. This migration is applied automatically during the DietPi update, your settings and data remain untouched. Many thanks for informing us about this possible enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4607
- DietPi-Software | PaperMC: Since Minecraft 1.17 requires Java 16 or newer, it does not work anymore on Debian versions below Bullseye and not on ARMv6, with the Java builds we ship, and has hence been disabled for those systems. AdoptOpenJDK is currently in the process of becoming "Adoptium" and creating a new APT repository, after which we can migrate to re-enable support on older Debian versions. On ARMv6 however I most likely won't work and the newest found Java build above version 8, running on ARMv6, is a single Zulu Java 11 build.

New Software:
- Java JRE | The OpenJDK Java Runtime Environment has been made available as dedicated software option with ID 196 (see changes above).

Fixes:
- DietPi-Software | Blynk Server: Resolved an issue where the install failed as the previous official repository has been removed by Blynk Inc. We switched to a fork, created hours before the repository removal, to preserve the install option and save users from being forced to use the commercial cloud servers. But note that there is no guarantee that the official apps will keep supporting it for long. In case older versions of the apps might need to be used.
- DietPi-Software | Roon Extension Manager: Resolved an issue where the installer failed when dietpi-software was executed with sudo as unprivileged user. The installer internally uses the SUDO_USER variable to perform some tasks, which fails to download the container startup shell script, as only root can write to the download location. Many thanks to @Esad-np for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4462
- DietPi-Software | Java JRE: Resolved an issue where the install failed on ARMv6: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4509#issuecomment-876413815
- DietPi-Software | Java JRE: Resolved an issue where the install failed on Raspbian Bullseye systems, since Raspbian has no compiled Java 17 packages yet.
- DietPi-Software | VSCodium: Added the missing dependency on ALSA for cases where no desktop is installed and VSCodium is started as standalone X server session. Many thanks to @Gill-Bates for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4610
- DietPi-Software | Bazarr: Resolved an issue where the install failed, as assets have been moved into an own repository, bundled with now release downloads. Many thanks to @psi5asp for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4615
- DietPi-Software | phpSysInfo: Resolved an issue where the install failed because of a changed download URL. Many thanks to @robex for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | LXDE: Resolved an issue on Raspberry Pi Bullseye systems, where the install failed. Many thanks to @ravenclaw900 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4555#issuecomment-898780672
- DietPi-Software | PiJuice: Resolved an issue where the install failed on Bullseye systems. Many thanks for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4643
- DietPi-Software | LXQt: Resolved an issue where the install failed on Bullseye systems. Many thanks to @LieDanG for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4656
- DietPi-Software | PaperMC: Resolved an issue where the install failed due to missing build dependencies.
- DietPi-Software | ProFTPD: Resolved an issue where the service start failed on Bullseye systems due to an invalid config entry. Many thanks to @twikedk for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4666
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: Resolved an issue where the install failed on ARMv6 Bullseye images, as neither Raspbian nor the Raspberry Pi repository contain a Kodi package yet. We ship now an own package. Many thanks to @sibofax for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4650

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4668

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v7.4
(2021-07-24)

Changes:
- DietPi-Update | A new live patching system has been implemented. This allows us to ship little fixes and updates, that are safe to apply with a one-line command, until the next DietPi version is released. Live patches are checked for together with DietPi updates and a notification is shown in the login banner as well, when new live patches have been found. When available, each patch can be individually applied or dismissed and the login banner won't bother you again about patches that you have seen in the dietpi-update menu already, regardless whether you applied them or not.
- DietPi-Globals | G_AGUP: Our "apt-get update" wrapper will now throw an error, when some index files couldn't be downloaded, e.g. due to DNS failure. Currently "apt-get update" prints a warning but does not return an error code. It is better to have an error handler prompt here, where we have an associated command output, than later when package installs or upgrades fail because of outdated information or missing list files.
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: On ARMv6/7, piwheels.org is now used within pyenv, which ships pre-compiled wheels for many Python modules and by this speeds up the installation, first service start and install of new integrations.
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: Updated config steps to work with the new myMPD v8.0.0. Many thanks to @jcorporation for informing us about this major update and how to adjust our config steps: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4562
- DietPi-Software | Komga: Obsolete entries have been removed from the default config and file hashing will be disabled on new installs. Many thanks to @quyentruong for contributing this change: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4570

New Software:
- Synapse | A Matrix homeserver implementation has been added with software ID 125.
- PostgreSQL | A persistent advanced object-relational database server has been added with software ID 194.
- youtube-dl | The famous command-line program to download videos from YouTube and other video platforms has been added to DietPi-Software with ID 195.

Fixes:
- Debian Stretch | Since Armbian dropped support for Debian Stretch from their APT repository, Armbian-based Stretch systems will have their APT sources adjusted to pull kernel, device tree, bootloader and firmware packages from the Armbian Buster suite. These are compatible with all Debian versions and have no dependencies or dependants which could cause conflicts.
- DietPi-Set_swapfile | Resolved an issue where remounting the /tmp tmpfs filesystem failed, if another filesystem type was mounted at /tmp. This could be especially the case during DietPi-PREP image creation. Many thanks to @timocapa for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4573#issuecomment-884993352
- DietPi-Software | X11: Resolved an issue where the X server failed on PINE A64 as the wrong DDX driver packages were installed. Many thanks to @exadeci for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4541
- DietPi-Software | PaperMC: Resolved an issue where the install of Geyser and Floodgate plugins failed as the download link changed.
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Resolved an issue where install on ARMv6/7 failed if g++ was not installed.
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Resolved an issue where local/LAN access via IPv6 was blocked, when the option to block public access to the admin panel was selected. This does not work when global unicast IPv6 addresses (GUA) are used within the LAN, hence unique local addresses (ULA) needs to be enabled and used to access the Pi-hole admin panel. Many thanks to @dunxd for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4575

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4584

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v7.3
(2021-06-26)

Changes:
- DietPi-Automation | A new dietpi.txt setting "AUTO_SETUP_DHCP_TO_STATIC" has been added. When set to "1", DHCP leased network settings will be applied as static network settings automatically during first run setup. This works as well with older images, by adding the above setting to dietpi.txt.
- DietPi-Backup | The include/exclude filter handling has been reworked. /mnt (dietpi_userdata) and /media related rules are added now via the editable custom filter file, which gives users more control over these. Especially it allows to include other mount points below /mnt, hence external dietpi_userdata, which was previously impossible due to the order in which those filter rules are applied.
- DietPi-VPN | The killswitch has been adjusted to allow incoming SSH connections. Many thanks to @yslupdates for doing this request: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4447
- DietPi-Config | Support for the Allo Boss2 DAC OLED display has been added to the "Display Options" > "LCD/OLED Panel addon" menu. When selecting the Allo Boss2 DAC as sound card, you will be asked whether to enable the OLED display as well.
- DietPi-Software | Allo web UI: Updated to v13.3 which adds support for the Allo Boss2 DAC and resolves an issue where the Squeezelite service could not be controlled as the service path has changed. All credits go to Allo for implementing these changes.
- DietPi-Software | Cuberite: This has been enabled for ARMv8 systems, where the available ARMv7 binaries work just fine.

New Software:
- AdGuard Home | This DNS sinkhole ad blocker for your LAN, similar to Pi-hole, has been added with software ID 126.
- Beets | This command line music organizer and manager has been added with software ID 190.
- frp | This proxy system has been added as install option with ID 171.
- Snapcast Server | This multiroom audio server component has been added with software ID 191. Many thanks to @foxy82 for implementing this software title: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4465
- Snapcast Client | The multiroom audio client component has been added with software ID 192. Many thanks to @foxy82 for implementing this software title: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4465
- K3s | Added a lightweight Kubernetes implementation as install option with ID 193. Many thanks to @mortenlj for implementing this software title: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4476

Removed Software:
- Tomcat 8 | Tomcat version 8 is available until Debian Stretch only, from Buster on it's Tomcat 9. There is no reasonable configuration that DietPi-Software can do on top of installing the APT package, which can be easily done manually via "apt install tomcat9". The software option is hence removed from DietPi-Software, in favour of a manual package install.

Fixes:
- DietPi-JustBoom | Resolved an issue where the equalizer was always shown as "Off" even when it was just or previously enabled (v7.2 regression). Many thanks to @shao for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where network drives were detected as physical drives (v7.2 regression). Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4479
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where with AUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED=1 the OpenSSH client was always installed on first boot, even if it was not requested.
- DietPi-Software | Node-RED: Resolved an issue where the Python 3 RPi.GPIO module was tried to be installed as dependency on non-RPi devices (v7.2 regression). Many thanks to @TheAdminFrmoHell for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4478
- DietPi-Software | PI-SPC: Resolved a syntax error in the shutdown script loop. Many thanks to @renaudlarzilliere for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4488

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4515

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v7.2
(2021-05-29)

New SBC support:
- Pinebook Pro | Initial hardware identifier (ID: 46) and support for this device has been added to DietPi.
- NanoPi R4S | Initial hardware identifier (ID: 47) and support for this device has been added to DietPi.
- NanoPi R1 | Initial hardware identifier (ID: 48) and support for this device has been added to DietPi.

Changes:
- DietPi-DDNS | Added native support for FreeDNS and OVH.
- DietPi-VPN | Added native support for IPVanish and Private Internet access (PIA)
- DietPi-VPN | When "Reset" is selected, you're now offered to purge the OpenVPN package, as long as neither the OpenVPN (server) install option nor PiVPN is installed. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4346
- DietPi-AutoStart | Selecting desktop autologin with non-root user has been made much more reliable. Previously the X server itself was started by the login user, which often requires additional permissions and sometimes, based on GPU and driver, is not possible at all without further customisation. The method has been changed so that LightDM is used for non-root autologins, just like it is for manual desktop logins, but logging into the desktop automatically with the chosen user.
- DietPi-Config | On Raspberry Pi, the Allo Boss2 DAC can now be selected from the sound card list. The OLED display that comes with this product currently needs to be installed manually by following Allo's instructions, but will be natively integrated into DietPi with the next release v7.3.
- DietPi-Software | A desktop preference choice has been added. Before first boot via new dietpi.txt AUTO_SETUP_DESKTOP_INDEX setting or with the new menu entry it can be now chosen which desktop to install when another software selection requires one, especially remote desktop solutions. It works like the webserver preference, so it only play a role when a desktop is installed as dependency and is overridden by manual desktop selections.
- DietPi-Software | A browser preference choice has been added. Before first boot via new dietpi.txt AUTO_SETUP_BROWSER_INDEX setting or with the new menu entry it can be now chosen whether and which browser to install automatically together with desktops. It only plays a role when a desktop is installed and is overridden by manual browser selections. Previously, Firefox was always installed together with desktops, which has now become an independent software option (see new software below).
- DietPi-Software | WiringPi: On RPi, a new updated fork of the deprecated original project is now used, which enables support for RPi 4/400 and CM4: https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi
- DietPi-Software | WiringPi: On new installs and reinstalls, the source/examples directory is now installed to /mnt/dietpi_userdata/WiringPi instead of /root/wiringPi, to enable general access to non-root users.
- DietPi-Software | Node.js: On ARMv6, new Node.js versions are now installed via unofficial builds. Official builds are provided up to Node v11 only. Many thanks to @ollliegits for adding support for this builds to our Node.js installer fork: https://github.com/MichaIng/nodejs-linux-installer/pull/2
- DietPi-Software | EmonPi: This software option has been renamed to "emonHub", the name of the data collector for the "emonPi" RPi energy monitor addon board. A much newer Python 3 compatible version form the official OpenEnergyMonitor repository is installed from now on, providing additional features and fixes.
- DietPi-Software | RPi Cam Web Interface: This install option has been disabled for 64-bit systems. It uses a 32-bit/armhf raspimjpeg binary that depends in 32-bit/armhf C library. It will be re-enabled once the project maintainer or we provide a native 64-bit/arm64 raspimjpeg binary.
- DietPi-Software | Roon Extension Manager: After a major upgrade to v1.0, it is now implemented as Docker container, rather than as Node.js module. The upgrade can be applied manually via "dietpi-software reinstall 86". Many thanks to @JanKoudijs for developing Roon Extension Manager and implementing the required changes into DietPi-Software: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4399
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: New installs and reinstall will have the DNS query logging duration reduced to 2 days. An internal discussion revealed that no-one of us uses logs old than a few hours, while those are kept for a year by default, leading to database sizes from hundreds of MiBs to GiBs. We leave it at 2 days so that dashboard graphs/diagrams are not empty on Pi-hole (re)start. Users who require long-term DNS query data for statistics or similar, can easily increase the TTL, shown as well in our docs.

New Software:
- Firefox | The Mozilla browser has now become an independent software option with the ID 67 (see changes above).

Removed Software:
- LibSSL1.0.0 | This old library was kept for backwards-compatibility with old binaries but is not required anymore for any binary installed by DietPi-Software. It has hence been removed from the software list.

Fixes:
- Odroid XU4 | Resolved an issue where installs and possibly other tasks hang, because the device ran out of entropy. All Odroid XU4 system will have the unsupported hardware random generator daemon removed and the software HAVEGE daemon installed instead for entropy generation. Many thanks to @szabolcs-toth for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4318
- DietPi-Banner | Resolved an issue where the MOTD was not updated via daily cron job, if the banner settings have not been changed yet, hence no config file exists. Since the MOTD is enabled by default, it needs to be updated as well if the config file does not exist. Many thanks to @gorby-pranata for helping us discovering this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4292#issuecomment-830787256
- DietPi-Banner | Resolved an issue where DietPi-VPN stats could not be shown due to a false file path. Many thanks to @Maggus101 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4354
- DietPi-Banner and DietPi-VPN | Resolved an issue where the WAN IP could not be derived, as the external API service we used has server issues by times. We switched to a (hopefully) more reliable one with higher rate limit as well, until we find time to host an own GeoIP API. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4393
- DietPi-Update | Resolved an issue where updating from DietPi v6.16 or older did not complete as intended. Many thanks to @orotarobas for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4385
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where NTFS (and potentially other) filesystems were not detected correctly, leading to failing mount attempts at boot. Many thanks to @NoLifer for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where info for drives with a systemd.automount unit was not detected correctly, leading to invalid fstab entries. Many thanks to @cocoflan and @BillyCorgan1 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4339
- DietPi-JustBoom | Resolved an issue where the equalizer had no effect in some cases. Many thanks to @zackdvd for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | Resolved an issue with Lighttpd, where lighty-enable-mod or lighty-disable-mod failed, if the related config was already enabled or disabled, respectively. Many thanks to @staxfax for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4336
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where changing the locale generated it but did not apply it as new system default. Many thanks to @bamyasi for reporting the issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3515#issuecomment-840751875
- DietPi-Software | Python 3: Resolved an issue where installing pip on Stretch systems failed, due to a changed download URL. Many thanks to @tfmeier for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Webmin: Resolved an issue where restarts from the web interface only stopped the service. Many thanks to @Burgess85 and @Keridos for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/webmin/5145, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4327
- DietPi-Software | Docker Compose: Resolved an issue on ARMv8 Debian Stretch systems, where the install failed because of missing development headers. Many thanks to @tfmeier for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | rTorrent: Resolved an issue where pre-v7.1 reinstalls with Lighttpd did not update the webserver configuration to provide the new RPC socket proxy. Many thanks to @bbsixzz for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4330
- DietPi-Software | rTorrent: Resolved an issue where v7.1 reinstalls failed. Many thanks to @Joulinar for fixing it.
- DietPi-Software | Radarr: Resolved an issue where an older fallback version was installed, rather than the latest one. Many thanks to @Takerman for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4350
- DietPi-Software | Node.js: Resolved an issue on ARMv6 where installing further modules via web interface failed, as an incompatible Node.js version was installed. The latest Node.js version is now installed via unofficial builds (see changes above). Many thanks to @torwan for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | RPi Cam Web Interface: Resolved two issues: Reinstalls failed when certain files in the web interface existed already and the shutdown and reboot buttons from the web interface failed due to insufficient webserver permissions.
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: Resolved an issue where an attempt was made during install to create a desktop entry, even if no desktop environment was installed. Many thanks to @sidgeg for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Bitwarden_RS: This project has been renamed by its author into "vaultwarden", to avoid confusion and potential legal issues with original Bitwarden software. This caused our install option to fail. To apply this important change to all Bitwarden_RS instances, it will be migrated via reinstall during DietPi update. As compiling can take up to several hours, users are informed at the beginning of the DietPi update, with the option to cancel and apply it at a later time. All data and configs will be preserved during the reinstall. Many thanks to @math-gout for informing us about this change: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4325
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Resolved an issue where the install failed, as running "pyenv init -" does not complement the PATH variable anymore.
- DietPi-Software | Mosquitto: Resolved an issue where the install failed on ARMv8 systems. Many thanks to @fra87 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4424
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: Resolved an issue on 64-bit RPi systems, where starting Kodi outside of a desktop session (e.g. using the Kodi dietpi-autostart option) failed, as our script tried to start it without X server (intended on 32-bit RPi systems). Many thanks to @Milemar for reporting this issue.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4422

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v7.1
(2021-04-28)

Supported SBC changes:
- For historical reasons, DietPi had internal hardware identifiers for SBCs which are not officially supported anymore for a long time, namely various Orange Pi and Banana Pi models, BeagleBone Black and LeMaker Guitar. Since we do not provide a reference image and do not test features on those boards, we have no chance to reasonably use those hardware IDs code-wise to apply tweaks or enable features, which renders them meaningless. To avoid wrong assumptions, we hence removed the identifies for the named SBC models. As a replacement, we added a set of generic SoC identifiers, which can as well be selected from within the DietPi-PREP system converter script. This means that one is e.g. able to select "Generic Allwinner H3" and have an SoC identifier set by this, which is used within the code for conditionals based on the SoC, e.g. regarding GPU acceleration and other SoC-internal hardware features. The removed SBC models are converted automatically to those generic identifiers, so that e.g. after the update an OrangePi PC will be shown in our scripts and banner as "Generic Allwinner H3". While it looks like a degradation, it is a hardening, as it assures that no false assumptions and conditionals are triggered in our scripts but only those which we can know for sure being true, regardless of the initial Debian image you used.
- We removed the Firefly RK3399 from our supported devices list, as not a single user is reported via DietPi-Survey (https://dietpi.com/survey/#device). If case there were actually Firefly RK3399 DietPi systems, not participating DietPi-Survey, those would be migrated to the "Generic Rockchip RK3399" identifier, which code-wise maintains the exact same support.

Changes:
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | It is now possible to obtain certificates for multiple domains, given as comma-separated list, with the first domain used as primary webserver name.
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | It is now possible to obtain certificates without having a webserver installed. Certbot can start an own internal webserver for such case and the certificate can then be used to manually enable HTTPS for other web applications, running on other ports than 80/443.
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | It is now possible to enable OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) stapling for the obtained certificate. This allows clients to check if the certificate has been revoked, e.g. when the server has been compromised or the private key stolen.
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | Lighttpd: HTTPS is now enabled for IPv6 requests and the deprecated TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 are disabled from Debian Buster on. With the Lighttpd version shipped by Debian Stretch, those TLS versions cannot be disabled.
- DietPi-NordVPN | The script received a major rework to allow being setup as ProtonVPN client and even with a custom OVPN config. For this reason it has been renamed to "DietPi-VPN", with the script moved to /boot/dietpi/dietpi-vpn and the console command alias changed to "dietpi-vpn" accordingly. Additionally a killswitch feature has been added which forcefully drops all WAN packets not sent through the VPN, when the connection got lost, until the VPN is disconnected manually/intentionally. Further is IPv6 now automatically disabled when the VPN connection is established. This is required to prevent IPv6 leaks as most public VPN providers/servers do not support IPv6. When it has not been disabled before, IPv6 is re-enabled automatically once the VPN connection stops. Many thanks to @ravenclaw900 for doing this major rework: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4180
- DietPi-Arr_to_RAM | Support for Sonarr v3 and Radarr v3 has been added. On first link to RAM, a script "/mnt/dietpi_userdata/(sonarr|radarr|lidarr)/dietpi-arr_to_RAM.sh" is created, which allows updating the linked database backups via the programs "Custom Script" feature. Since v3, it is not possible anymore to pass arguments to custom script or call scripts inside the /boot directory at all, which broke the previous "/boot/dietpi/misc/dietpi-arr_to_RAM 2 (sonarr|radarr|lidarr)" calls in two ways.
- DietPi-FS_partition_resize | Added support to automatically resize F2FS and Btrfs filesystems on first boot.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Added support for resizing F2FS and Btrfs filesystems as well as format- and filesystem check & repair support for XFS filesystems.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | When adding Samba mounts, credentials are not added in plain text to /etc/fstab anymore, but stored instead in a separate per-mount credential file with strict root-only read permissions. Many thanks to @TheOriginalMrWolf for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4082
- DietPi-Config | Added a safe overclocking profile for RPi 3+ models. Many thanks to @lone for doing long-term stability tests and reporting back the result.
- DietPi-Config | When disabling the RPi camera feature, the bcm2835_isp kernel module is now additionally blacklisted. Since kernel 5.X it is otherwise loaded automatically and pulls in the whole camera modules stack as dependency, adding some additional memory usage and boot overhead. Many thanks to @ferbar for making us aware of this: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4203
- DietPi-Software | The "optimised" and "additional" software menus have been merged. The separation did not follow consistent rules and this change allows us to have development tools and platforms in a more prominent position. Also it simplifies the software selection and addresses possible confusion about that separation among our users.
- DietPi-Software | Since multiple software titles were listening on the ports 5000 and 8000, the default ports of those titles have been changed to avoid conflicts on concurrent installs. No change is done during the DietPi update, even a software title reinstall won't change it, in most cases. For details see the individual software changes below.
- DietPi-Software | Mosquitto: Since v2, by default remote connections and no unauthenticated requests are possible anymore. On fresh installs and reinstalls, we'll enable remote connections, but create a password file, so that MQTT clients need to authenticate with username "mosquitto" and the global software password by default. Many thanks to @mattsmithuk for reporting this change: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4133
- DietPi-Software | Icecast: The streaming server can now be installed on virtual machines as well and the default web UI password will now be the global software password instead of a random one. Since the DarkIce config file /etc/darkice.cfg contains the global software password in plain text, its permission mode is changed to 600 to limit read access to the root user only.
- DietPi-Software | OctoPrint: On fresh installs, the default listening port has been changed from 5000 to 5001 to avoid conflicts with Shairport Sync.
- DietPi-Software | Firefox Sync Server: On fresh installs, the default listening port has been changed from 5000 to 5002 to avoid conflicts with Shairport Sync.
- DietPi-Software | rTorrent: For performance reasons, and to avoid conflicts with Shairport Sync, the default SCGI/RPC access has been changed from TCP port 5000 to UNIX socket. This change is applied on fresh installs and reinstalls of rTorrent, as it requires a change on both all sides, rTorrent, ruTorrent and the webserver. HTTP authentication is now enforced for the rTorrent RPC access with all webservers, using the global software password by default, and the password hash algorithm has been hardened with Nginx.
- DietPi-Software | WebIOPi: On fresh installs, the default listening port has been changed from 8000 to 8002 to avoid conflicts with Icecast. Additionally the install process has been slightly sped up by skipping unnecessary installer-internal APT calls.
- DietPi-Software | Koel: On fresh installs and reinstalls, the listening port has been changed from 8000 to 8003 to avoid conflicts with Icecast. Additionally the install process has been simplified and dependencies reduces, since after Koel v5.0.0 pre-compiled frontend binaries are available. This also allows a completely unattended install now. As little security hardening, the Koel MariaDB database password has been changed to a long random character string and the config files permission mode has been changed to 600 to permit read access to the Koel service user only. Finally as little performance enhancement, Koel now connects via UNIX socket to MariaDB instead of view TCP connection, which allows to disable TCP listening in MariaDB.
- DietPi-Software | YaCy: New installs and reinstalls will now have the latest version detected and downloaded automatically. This enables an easy update method by simply reinstalling YaCy via "dietpi-software reinstall 133", independent of the DietPi version.
- DietPi-Software | Remote.It: After the install finished, it is now offered to do the interactive "connectd_installer" setup directly. Neither is a reboot required, nor does any service need to run to be registered. This is especially helpful for installs via "dietpi-software install 68", where the hint about this required setup was not shown before.
- DietPi-Software | Sonarr: Support for and migration to v3 has been implemented. Existing installs won't be migrated automatically, run "dietpi-software reinstall 144" to upgrade your Sonarr to v3. On DietPi update, Sonarr v2 users will receive a related notification.
- DietPi-Software | RPi.GPIO: This software option has been renamed to "Python 3 RPi.GPIO" to make clear that it is a Python package. In our efforts to migrate all software options to Python 3, only the Python 3 package is installed from now on. To install it for Python 2, one needs to run the following command manually form console: "apt install python-rpi.gpio"

New Scripts:
- DietPi-VPN | This new tool has been added, which allows you to establish VPN connections to known public VPN providers or connect via custom OpenVPN configuration file. It incorporates all features from the previous DietPi-NordVPN script and more (see changes above).
- DietPi-DDNS | This new tool has been added, which allows you to manage domains for your dynamic IP address. Select a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) provider or add a custom API URL, to have your DDNS entry updated regularly, via cURL and Cron job. Among others, it supports No-IP and replaces the No-IP client that DietPi supported until now.

New Software:
- DietPi-Software | Kubo: The InterPlanetary File System peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol node is now available for install with the software ID 186. Many thanks to @ravenclaw900 for implementing this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4232
- DietPi-Software | CUPS: The common UNIX printing system is now available as optimised install option with the software ID 187, including a web interface to manage and share local and network printers across your LAN.
- DietPi-Software | Go: Being previously tied into the OpenBazaar install, Go has now become a dedicated install option with the software ID 188. This includes the runtime system, package installer and compiler tool chain, as found at https://golang.org/dl/.
- DietPi-Software | VSCodium: As alternative to MS VSCode without MS branding, telemetry and licensing, the VSCodium code editor, with support for various programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Go, Node.js, Python and C++, has been added as software install option to DietPi.

Removed Software:
- DietPi-Software | DietPi-NordVPN: As part of the major rework (see changes above), the dedicated install option has been removed. The script is available OOTB and will download, install or remove parts depending on your provider choice and menu selections.
- DietPi-Software | No-IP: As result of the new DietPi-DDNS tool (see new scripts above), the dedicated install option has been removed. DietPi-DDNS is always available and does not require any additional download or install of external files.

Fixes:
- DietPi-Config/DietPi-PREP | Resolved an issue on Debian Bullseye, when toggling serial consoles, where /etc/securetty is attempted to be altered even that it is not used and does not exist anymore since Debian Bullseye. Many thanks to @NastyDesertFox for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4205
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on Sparky SBC, where selecting the generic USB DAC sound card option failed, due to invalid amixer calls. Many thanks to @Balmoral86 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4249
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Fixed detection and visualisation of loop devices in menu.
- DietPi-Set_userdata | When dietpi_userdata was moved to another drive, the intended dietpi:dietpi ownership was not applied to the target directory as intended. This is required by some software titles, like Syncthing and file servers, to permit the creation of files and directories. Many thanks to @redschumi for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4228
- DietPi-Config | Worked around an issue in RPi, where selecting a sound card ended with an error prompt in certain circumstances. Many thanks to @sturbs for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4306
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where the "uninstall" command did not work and the "reinstall" did not show the intended backup prompt. Many thanks to @Zeuskk for reporting this v7.0 regression.
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where directory permissions could be wrong because of 7zr overriding the default umask. This lead e.g. to 403 browser error on a fresh Single File PHP Gallery install. Many thanks to @Alexgolshtein for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4251
- DietPi-Software | X11: Resolved an issue on RPi where the X server start failed when the KMS device tree overlay was not enabled. Many thanks to @NightLink42 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4175
- DietPi-Software | LXDE: Resolved an issue where after installing LXDE, the system booted into the LightDM desktop login mask automatically, even if desktop autologin was not chosen via dietpi-autostart. Many thanks to @manilx for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Portainer: Resolved an issue where the uninstall failed, if the container or image was removed manually before, or not found for a different reason. Many thanks to @redschumi for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4224
- DietPi-Software | Icecast: Resolved an issue where DarkIce fails to connect to Icecast by default, due to an invalid hostname in its config.
- DietPi-Software | Koel: Resolved issues which caused a failing install, caused by changed archive directory names and changed Laravel dependencies.
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: Resolved an issue where the service fails to start because of a renamed setting. Many thanks to @sofad for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4256
- DietPi-Software | O!MPD: Resolved an issue where browsing the media directory from the web UI failed because of a missing slash in the local config file. Many thanks to @pinkdot for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: Worked around an issue on 64-bit RPi systems, where the wrong Kodi package is tried to be installed, causing an APT failure. Many thanks to @mmnpkf for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4194
- DietPi-Software | Chromium: Worked around an issue on 64-bit RPi systems, where the install failed, as The Raspberry Pi repository does not ship a 64-bit build yet. The Chromium package from the Debian repository is now installed instead.
- DietPi-Software | Sonarr/Radarr: Having both now installed as v3 or later, resolves a long outstanding issue, where importing downloads to filesystems without native UNIX permissions support, including Samba/CIFS mounts, failed.
- DietPi-Software | WebIOPi: Resolved an issue where the GPIO pins could not be toggled via web interface by moving to a newer fork of this project. This additionally enabled us to run it with Python 3 and enable it on RPi 3 and RPi 4 models. Many thanks to @torwan for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Plex Media Server: Resolved an issue where secure remote access via app.plex.tv did not work if Unbound with DNS rebinding protection is installed. Many thanks to @danmo117 for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | MATE: Resolved an issue where DietPi menu and desktop shortcuts could not be started, as the MATE terminal emulator is not compatible with the "start in console" flag of desktop shortcuts. xterm is now installed together with MATE, to replace the default terminal emulator. Many thanks to @maya95 for reporting this issue.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4305

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v7.0
(2021-02-28)

Changes:
- DietPi-Update | A new update check system has been implemented, which checks for a minimum required Debian and DietPi version and migrates systems with either too old Debian version or too old DietPi version to a different Git branch automatically. This especially smoothes the migration of our code base to newer Debian versions and the alternative branch can be used to inform and support Debian distribution upgrades and to upgrade the DietPi code to an intermediate version from where the system can be migrated back to the regular stable/master branch. Since this change required a new repository version file, we took the chance and incremented the DietPi core version to v7.0. This however has no further meaning, all previously supported DietPi and Debian versions remain supported and the change enables us to not require fresh image installs for major upgrades, like the upgrade from v159 to v6.0 did a few years ago.
- Network | A change has been implemented on the order in which network-related systemd service targets are reached. "network.target" and "network-online.target" are now reach after all network interfaces have been configured, rather then already after only the loopback interface "lo" has been configured. This affects only systemd services which are not started by DietPi-Services, e.g. SSH/DNS/VPN/VNC servers, with the effect that they are assured to be able to bind to interfaces/IPs, where currently they would fail. The downside is, if one has an Ethernet adapter configured via dietpi-config or /etc/network/interfaces (as allow-hotplug device), but the cable not connected, affected services may be delayed until the interface bring-up timed out.
- DietPi-Backup | A new feature has been added which allows to automatically restore a dietpi-backup on first boot. For this set the new dietpi.txt option AUTO_SETUP_BACKUP_RESTORE=1, to get a list of found backups to select from (this does not work in combination with AUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED=1). All attached drives are mounted temporarily and searched automatically. Set AUTO_SETUP_BACKUP_RESTORE=2 to have the first found backup restored non-interactively (this works in combination with AUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED=1). The restore runs after the initial update, hence works with older images as well and can be done via SSH connection. Credits go to @ravenclaw900 for implementing this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/4112
- DietPi-Backup | Support for XFS and ZFS target file system types has been added, which fully support the required symlink and POSIX permissions capabilities.
- DietPi-Config | RPi: An option has been added to toggle the SPI interface. Many thanks to @incanus for resurrecting this old feature request: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/98#issuecomment-783650204
- DietPi-Software | The mandatory reboot after installs has been removed. Installed services, which are not controlled by DietPi-Services, but would start automatically on reboot, are now started at the end of installs instead. A manual reboot is still a good idea, but strictly required only in rare cases. Many thanks to @Games-Crack for doing this suggesting: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4032
- DietPi-Software | Installs do not imply all APT package upgrades anymore. While we recommend to keep all APT packages upgraded regularly, the new daily APT check and info within the DietPi-Banner, helps to keep you informed to do the best decision yourself whether and when to apply which package upgrade. On first run installs the full upgrade is however kept, to assure each image starts in fully upgraded state, and packages which are required for the actual software choices you're installing, are upgraded as well, when installed already.
- DietPi-Software | Uninstalls do not stop other services anymore. E.g. your webserver or media streaming server will stay active while you uninstall that other software that you don't require anymore. Since uninstalls do not require much RAM or CPU resources, this is perfectly fine. Many thanks to @mrgreaper giving the hint: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4116
- DietPi-Software | Unbound: On install in combination with Pi-hole, no additional configuration file will be created anymore but the adjusted interface binding and port will be applied to "/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/dietpi.conf". Declaring "interface" in two configuration files do not override each other but lead to two concurrent bindings, which is not intended. The two files, if present, will be merged as well on DietPi update. It is hence intended that admins change "dietpi.conf" directly, if required, and this file won't be overwritten on reinstalls to preserve local changes. Additionally, on new installs, the configuration file will be better sorted and contain comments to explain their purpose.
- DietPi-Software | Unbound: On new installs, by default access is now granted to all private IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges instead of to the 192.168.0.0/16 subnet only, which includes VPN interfaces, containers and cases of multiple local networks the server is attached to.
- DietPi-Software | Unbound: A monthly cron job is now created to keep the root hints file updated. Many thanks to @APraxx for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4077
- DietPi-Software | Python 3 pip: pip and pip-based installs on ARMv6 and ARMv7 boards will have the piwheels.org repository for pre-compiled wheels added automatically, which can reduce build dependencies and compile time dramatically.
- DietPi-Software | Node-RED: New installs and reinstalls will setup Node-RED as local module for the "nodered" service user, rather than as global system module/command. This allows upgrading and removing all related Node modules through the web interface, instead of just the ones which were installed via web interface. Additionally a console alias for the "node-red-admin" CLI command has been added so that running this command with any user will call the local Node-RED instance as "nodered" service user.
- DietPi-Software | Docker: The Docker APT repository is now installed manually instead of using the official Docker installer. This allows us to enable the Docker install option for Debian Bullseye systems, if only to allow widened testing of this upcoming Debian release with DietPi.

Interface Changes:
- DietPi-Banner | Running the script without input argument will now open the menu instead of printing the banner. The console alias has been adjusted accordingly, so that it is now possible to run "dietpi-banner 0" and "dietpi-banner 1" from console to have full and short banner versions printed. The "dietpi-banner" console command remains opening the menu.

New Software:
- DietPi-Software | Docker Compose: A tool to define and run multi-container Docker applications can now be installed through our software selection. Docker will be pulled in as dependency automatically.
- DietPi-Software | Box86: An x86 wrapper/emulator for ARMv7 systems is now available for install. Thanks to it's ability to wrap ARMv7 shared system libraries to be used with i386 binaries, often no additional libraries need to be installed. Thanks to binfmt, it will be invoked automatically when an i386 binary is executed.
- DietPi-Software | Steam: By automatically pulling in Box86 as dependency, Steam can now be installed on ARMv7 boards. It won't run perfectly stable yet and has limited features and game support, but we're optimistic that further improvements will address this in the future. Check out our documentation about it: https://dietpi.com/docs/software/gaming/#steam
- DietPi-Software | mjpg-streamer: Lightweight multi-source and multi-output plugin JPEG streamer, now available for install. By default your attached camera capture will be streamed to a custom HTTP port. When installed along with OctoPrint, both will be automatically configured to work together. The Raspberry Pi camera module support is enabled by default, when installed on Raspberry Pi.

Fixes:
- Audio | Resolved a bug with Debian Buster, where the ALSA state daemon was always running, even when it was not configured.
- DietPi-Globals | G_OBTAIN_CPU_TEMP: Negative temperatures are not trusted anymore, "N/A" will be printed instead. This allows a generic approach to fix/allow temperature estimation on further SBC models. Many thanks to @Thanapat for reporting a related issue on Roseapple Pi.
- DietPi-Set_swapfile | Resolve an issue where "zram"/"zram0" dietpi.txt path entries were dropped, when running the script without input arguments. This especially broke applying zram-swap on first boot. Many thanks to @Dr0bac for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4002
- DietPi-Software | Bitwarden_RS: Resolved an issue where the self-signed TLS certificate could not be imported on iOS. To apply this fix to an existing instance, the configuration file "/mnt/dietpi_userdata/bitwarden_rs/bitwarden_rs.env" needs to be removed or moved to a different location, so "dietpi-software reinstall 183" will re-create the configuration and TLS certificate.
- DietPi-Software | Unbound: Resolved an issue where during install in combination with Pi-hole the service restart could have failed. Many thanks to @Ernstian for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2409#issuecomment-739154892
- DietPi-Software | Unbound: Resolved an issue where the service start failed if the host system had a local IP address outside of the 192.168.0.0/16 subnet. Many thanks to @faxesystem for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2409#issuecomment-749174984
- DietPi-Software | ReadyMedia: Resolved an issue where the media library was not rescanned on service start.
- DietPi-Software | WiFi Hotspot: Resolved an issue where the install on Armbian-based images with RTL8188C* WiFi chip failed. Many thanks to @smogan71 for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Medusa: This software option has been disabled on Stretch systems, since it now requires Python >=3.6, which is not available in the Debian Stretch repository. If you run Medusa on a Stretch system, it will continue to work, but updating will either not be possible or break it. Many thanks to @aermak for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3991
- DietPi-Software | WiringPi: Resolved an issue where the install failed, if the /usr/local/bin directory was not present. Many thanks to @bruz for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | PaperMC: Resolved an issue where the install failed due to changed download URLs and stabilised service start and config creation by setting the Java heap size and allowing more time for the startup on smaller SBCs. Many thanks to @omavoss for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | OpenTyrian: The install option has been disabled on x86_64, since the Debian package comes with a different file structure and it has been disabled on 64-bit RPi systems, since the binary has been compiled for armhf.
- DietPi-Software | Domoticz: Resolved an issue where saving custom scripts and starting with a template did not work. Many thanks to @tec13 for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where for ruTorrent, Koel and Bitwarden_RS the automatic newest version detection failed and instead a possibly older fallback was used. Many thanks to @kelvmod for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4105
- DietPi-Software | LXQt: Resolved visual issues with our default configuration of Debian Buster, drastically simplified and cleaned up the files we ship.
- DietPi-Software | SABnzbd: Resolved an issue on Stretch where the install failed due to raised minimum Python version with SABnzbd v3.2.0. If Python 3.5 is installed, SABnzbd v3.1.1 will be installed now to allow keeping the install option enabled for now. Many thanks to @19eighties for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2762#issuecomment-787118995

v6.34
(20/12/20)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- Raspberry Pi 400 | Correct detection for this new Raspberry Pi model has been added.
- DietPi-Globals | In DietPi scripts, the PATH variable is now overwritten with the Debian/bash system default to assure that no broken or manipulated PATH can be passed via e.g. "su" or "sudo -E". This means that overrides must be placed in /usr/local/(s)bin now, which as well was the only save location for system-wide overrides before. Many thanks to @tandy-1000 for reporting a related issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3873
- DietPi-Set_swapfile | Hardened permissions of the /dev/zram0 zram-swap device to be only accessible by root user (mode 0600) and interpret input argument "/dev/zram0" and "zram0" as zram-swap as well, aside of "zram" only. Many thanks to @mennerausr for reporting a related issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3869
- DietPi-NordVPN | A function has been added update the NordVPN server list, e.g. when new servers are available that are closer to your location.
- DietPi-JustBoom | The ALSA equalizer settings are not stored to /var/lib/dietpi/dietpi-config/.alsaequal.bin where all users/services can read it and all members of the "dietpi" group (or root) can create and write to it. Many thanks to @wowcut for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3950
- DietPi-CloudShell | Several enhancements have been applied. The autostart option now runs the script in foreground, which means that it can always be terminated via "CTRL+C" from an attached keyboard. The original sized font is now restored on exit and terminal settings reset. Also the menu has gone through some fine tuning, showing current settings hopefully a bid more outstanding.
- DietPi-Update | It is now possible to enable automated APT package update checks and even upgrade them on a daily bases. Set the new dietpi.txt setting "CONFIG_CHECK_APT_UPDATES" to "1" (default) to enable daily APT update checks. The result is shown in the DietPi login banner, in a similar way an available DietPi update is presented. Set "CONFIG_CHECK_APT_UPDATES" to "2" to have APT packages upgraded automatically on a daily bases and review the logs at /var/tmp/dietpi/logs/dietpi-update_apt.log. Cron is used for the schedule, which means that you can control the execution time via dietpi-cron > "cron.daily". Many thanks to @ravenclaw900 for implementing this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3899
- DietPi-Config | RPi: When applying less than 32 MiB GPU memory, the VCSM (VideoCore Shared Memory) device and kernel module are disabled now. The automatically loaded cut-down firmware files do not support it which leads to currently 5 expected kernel error messages. Disabling it in the first place might marginally speed up boot and reduce memory usage, but more importantly reduces confusion or worries induced by to the error messages.
- DietPi-Config | Audio Options: Added an option to switch between direct audio output and automatic software conversions, for channels, format and rate via ALSA "plug" plugin. This may be required to play any raw wav file regardless of sound card capabilities and without defining supported values manually. Having automated software conversions enabled matches the Debian ALSA defaults but may increase CPU usage and decrease sound quality.
- DietPi-Config | RPi: When enabling I2C support, the Python 3 SMbus module is now installed instead of the deprecated Python 2 version. This matches as well the dependency of PiJuice, which nowadays pulls Python 3 SMbus as package dependency, hence this change avoids the obsolete install of the whole Python 2 stack when PiJuice is installed through dietpi-software. Many thanks to @Trunkzeh for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3963#issuecomment-748547394
- DietPi-Software | OpenBazaar: Build is now done with the currently latest Go v1.15.3 and the service runs as unprivileged user "openbazaar" instead of root.
- DietPi-Software | XRDP: Remote desktop connections can now be done with the "Xorg" method and hence don't require an active VNC server anymore. New installs will not pull TigerVNC as dependency and if only RDP is required, TigerVNC can be uninstalled.
- DietPi-Software | Single File PHP Gallery: Updated new installs to latest v4.7.1. Run "dietpi-software reinstall 56" to upgrade your existing instance.
- DietPi-Software | MineOS: A systemd service is now used to run the daemon in favour of the previous supervisor, the obsolete "mineos" user is not created anymore, Node.js v11 is used to build MineOS, obsolete dependencies have been removed and a reinstall will now perform a MineOS upgrade and the existing /etc/mineos.conf is not replaced anymore.
- DietPi-Software | Mycroft AI: By default, the ALSA automatic conversions plugin is enabled now on install, which enables OOTB compatibility with all wav sound formats and sound card. Additionally listener sampling rate override (48000 Hz) has been removed, reverting to Mycroft default (16000 Hz), which might solve an issue with hanging microphone level in CLI and related failing voice detection.
- DietPi-Software | Gogs: Has been enabled for ARMv8 boards and on ARMv7 boards the newest version is installed again, which was not the case since Gogs v0.12. due to changed download names. Many thanks to @MadKernel for bringing ARMv8 support back to our attention.
- DietPi-Software | Folding@Home: Is now available for ARMv8 (arm64) boards. Donate your idle CPU power to help researchers fighting against diseases like Cancer, Alzheimer, Ebola and COVID-19.
- DietPi-Software | Radarr: Has been upgraded to the newest major version 3, including the required branch migration (from "develop" to "master") and, for non-ARMv6 boards, a migration to the now available .NET-based build away from Mono. This change is applied to all DietPi systems via Radarr reinstall, preserving your data and configs of course.
- DietPi-Software | OctoPrint: Is now available via PyPI repository, hence can be installed and updated easier and faster without downloading and building from the sources. Git is not required anymore, as the internal updater as well uses Python pip only. We migrate all DietPi OctoPrint instances to the new version and new install method, so that the Git/install directory /opt/octoprint is obsolete and removed. All your data will be preserved, of course. Many thanks to @Stinocon for reporting issues related to our previous implementation: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3940

New Software Packages:
- DietPi-Software | Portainer: Simplify your Docker container management via Portainer web interface, now available for install. Many thanks to @Joulinar for implementing this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3933
- DietPi-Software | Tor Relay: Become part of the Tor Project and turn your DietPi into a Tor relay to help others surf the Internet safely and privately. Many thanks to @ravenclaw900 for implementing this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3921
- DietPi-Software | PaperMC: Highly optimised Minecraft server, written in Java, extensible via plugins, now available for install. Many thanks to @ravenclaw900 for implementing this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3828
- DietPi-Software | Unbound: Validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver, now available for install and integrate with Pi-hole. Many thanks to @ravenclaw900 for implementing this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3872
- DietPi-Software | Bitwarden_RS: An unofficial Bitwarden password manager server with web UI, written in Rust, now available for install. Many thanks to @CactiChameleon9 for implementing this software option: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3724

Removed Software Packages:
- DietPi-Software | DietPi-CloudShell: The install option has been removed, but DietPi-CloudShell stays available of course. The install did nothing else than creating the service file and enabling the autostart option, but the script was always available and did work well without having the software option installed. The service is now as well available statically, the script can always be started from console via "dietpi-cloudshell" shortcut alias now and is shown in dietpi-launcher. Also non-root users can run now run it via "dietpi-cloudshell 1" (with intro) or "dietpi-cloudshell 2" (no intro), only changing the settings via menu (no command argument) requires root permissions.
- DietPi-Software | CloudPrint: This software option has been removed, since the Google Cloud Print service will be shut down at the end of 2020 and we don't want to offer software options which will work for at most two months. Please migrate to another printing solution in time. Already installed CloudPrint instances will remain installed and the system service remains functional until the end of the year. With the first DietPi release in 2021 we will remove service handling and offer the package removal during the update process. Further information can be found here: https://www.google.com/cloudprint/learn/
- DietPi-Software | Tonido: This software option has been removed, since it is not developed anymore for three years, no sources have been found and the latest binaries require ancient library versions which fail to be easily installed on currently supported Debian versions.

Bug Fixes:
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on RPi where the onboard 3.5mm jack selection did not work if an HDMI screen was attached. When selecting explicit either HDMI audio or onboard 3.5mm jack, the other one is now disabled on device tree level, which means it cannot be switched without reboot. This is currently the only known way to assure that 3.5mm jack is used for audio output regardless of now or later attached or detached HDMI screens. Many thanks to @corasaniti for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3887
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on RPi where selecting the waveshare32 LCD panel installed an outdated device tree overlay, incompatible with the current Linux 5.4 kernel. Many thanks to @black00019 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3881
- DietPi-Services | Resolved an issue where CPU affinity selection failed due to a syntax error.
- DietPi-BugReport | Resolved an issue where bug report uploads were cancelled if connection test on port 80/443 failed even that uploads are done via SFTP on port 22.
- DietPi-Cleaner | Resolved an issue where cleaner selection failed with a syntax error.
- DietPi-Sync | Resolved an issue where setting the delete mode to "On" did not have any effect on it. Many thanks to @mafioso12dk for reporting this issue.

- DietPi-Software | Medusa: Resolved an issue where Medusa failed to start after install. Many thanks to @Luan7805 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3842
- DietPi-Software | Webservers: Resolved an issue where reinstall failed if /var/www/html did not exist.
- DietPi-Software | Lighttpd: Resolved an issue where (re)install failed if the fastcgi or fastcgi-php module was enabled already.
- DietPi-Software | O!MPD: Resolved an issue where the URL check for youtube-dl failed.
- DietPi-Software | Single File PHP Gallery: Resolved an issue where directory previews were not shown due to missing permissions. Many thanks to @tallbastard for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | WebIOPi: Resolved an issue where the download and install failed.
- DietPi-Software | Nginx: Resolved an issue where the amount of worker processes was not set to the amount of CPU threads as intended.

- DietPi-Software | WiFi Hotspot: Resolved an issue on RPi with WiFi adapters using an RTL8188C* chip, where the service failed to start due to an invalid driver. Many thanks to @yerc for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | OctoPrint: Resolved an issue where the service and system could not be restarted anymore via OctoPrint web UI and, on RPi, the CPU throttling state could not be derived.
- DietPi-Software | Ampache: Resolved an issue where the install failed due to an incompatible PHP composer version and it was not possible to update the configuration file to a new version through the web interface. Many thanks to @kk345 for reporting these issues.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3982

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.33
(17/10/20)

API Changes:
- DietPi-Globals | The G_FP_DIETPI_USERDATA variable has been removed. Variables cannot be used in every context, e.g. not in config files stored on GitHub or dietpi.com for download, its value "/mnt/dietpi_userdata" does not change and using the path literally allows slightly simplified and hardened coding.

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- DietPi-Login | Logins do not wait for DietPi-PostBoot to finish anymore, as this is not strictly required. On local console, DietPi-PostBoot processing output practically blocks login until finished or timed out and logins on any other console like SSH or serial do not require it. DietPi-PostBoot only checks for DietPi updates, starts background services and prints the pre-login banner to local console, nothing that is required for console usage.
- DietPi-AutoStart | Autostart programs with a foreground process are now started as replacement for the DietPi-Login process via "exec" which saves 3-4 MiB RAM usage.
- DietPi-Software | When using an invalid input argument, dietpi-software now prints usage info to the terminal.
- DietPi-Software | The "dietpi" UNIX group has been made the primary group for all* services which ran with "Group=dietpi" before: Transmission, Mopidy, MiniDLNA, Airsonic, Plex Media Server, Emby Server, Medusa, Tonido, Blynk Server, SABnzbd, Koel, NZBGet. If the user (+group) is created by an external package or installer, the original primary group is kept as supplementary group to not possibly break access permissions to pre-created directories and files. *Only example from these changes is Deluge for now, since we don't want to run the separate web UI service with dietpi group permissions. In case of Tautulli, the dietpi group permissions are remove, since Tautulli does not require it.
- DietPi-Software | Bazarr: Companion application to Sonarr and Radarr, which manages and downloads subtitles based on your requirements, now available for install. Many thanks to @DiogoAbu for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2045
- DietPi-Software | phpBB: New installs will be v3.3.1 now, existing instances won't be touched as updates need to be done manually through the internal update mechanism, which includes the mandatory database migration. Additionally new installs will now be places at /var/www/phpbb, the old location /var/www/phpBB3 is still handled gracefully, if existing.
- DietPi-Software | OctoPrint: The service runs now as user "octoprint", the Git branch directory has been moved to /opt/octoprint and /mnt/dietpi_userdata/octoprint is the run users home and hence config and data directory now. To apply these changes, OctoPrint is reinstalled with DietPi v6.33, which includes the Python 3 migration (see v6.32 changelog) on Buster and Bullseye systems. This implies that the CLI ("octoprint" command) needs to be executed as user "octoprint" to invoke the correct configuration. A bash shell alias solves this automatically for all users with sudo permissions, but if you use a custom shell, the CLI needs to be called like: "sudo -u octoprint octoprint <command>". Many thanks to @ModischFabrications for reporting an issue that is related to the fact that the service ran as root user before: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3315
- DietPi-Software | Tautulli: Finally, directories, user and service are renamed from "plexpy" to "tautulli". Additionally it runs with Python 3 now instead of Python 2. These changes are applied as well during DietPi update.
- DietPi-Software | Baïkal: Update (re)install procedure to cover the new config directory and use the pre-packed release archives instead of raw source and composer. Additionally webserver configs have been added to harden access permissions.
- DietPi-Software | Docker: On fresh installs or reinstalls, logs are now done with limited verbosity to systemd-journald (RAM), accessible via "journalctl -u docker -u containerd" to reduce disk writes. Docker can be reinstalled via "dietpi-software reinstall 162". Many thanks to @SaturnusDJ for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2388
- DietPi-Software | Mosquitto: The official APT repository is now used where possible, which currently excludes ARMv8/arm64 and Raspbian/Debian Bullseye. This change is applied via reinstall during DietPi update. Many thanks to @marcobrianza for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3042
- DietPi-Software | Cuberite: A wrong directory name based on a typo has been fixed. A reinstall updates Cuberite and moves its install directory to /mnt/dietpi_userdata/cuberite as intended. This is applied via DietPi update but a backup is created to cover issues due to potential structural changes, especially for older instances installed at /etc/cubrite.
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: An update to Amiberry v3.3 is applied during DietPi v6.33 update.
- DietPi-Software | LXDE: By default, when double-clicking a desktop icon or executable file, it will be executed directly now, without being asked first what to do. This behaviour can be changed from within PCManFM file manager > "Edit" > "Preferences" > "General" > "Don't ask options to launch executable file".

Bug Fixes:
- General | Resolved an issue where using AUTO_UNMASK_LOGIND=1 or enabling Amiberry fastboot did not allow to start systemd-logind as intended if the required dbus package was not installed before. Many thanks to @Razerban for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3770
- RPi | Resolved an issue where Allo USBridge Sig (ASIX AX88179) Ethernet fails due to non-matching driver. Many thanks to @dsnyder0pc for reporting this issue any many thanks to Allo for providing stable branch driver builds and a method to compare kernel module layouts: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3725
- DietPi-Backup | Resolved an issue where F2FS was not supported as target location. Since it has full UNIX permissions and symlinks support and can be used as rootfs file system, it can be used for OS backups as well. Many thanks to @Cjkeenan for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/606#issuecomment-695944450
- DietPi-Set_swapfile | Resolved an issue where swapon failed on ext4 due to an external bug in Linux 5.7 and 5.8. The script now tries quick and less write-intense fallocate pre-allocation first, regardless of kernel version and file system type, and falls back to dd in case of failure. Many thanks to @auanasgheps for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3756
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where on devices with old Linux kernel versions (e.g. Sparky SBC with Linux 3.10.38) the Performance Options failed to open with a syntax error. Many thanks to @dsnyder0pc for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3799
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on RPi 2 where a wrong default SDRAM frequency was shown, which is 450 MHz instead of 400 MHz with current firmware.
- DietPi-Software | OpenTyrian: The autostart option and run script have been fixed and slightly enhanced to lower RAM usage a bid.
- DietPi-Software | Firefox Sync Server: Resolved an issue where the build failed due to missing MySQL/MariaDB headers, newly required. Many thanks to @kinoushe for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3774
- DietPi-Software | Firefox Sync Server: Resolved another issue where the build failed due to transition of the whole project from Python to Rust. We now stay on a fixed commit and won't ship newer Firefox Sync Server versions until this transition has been fully completed, as the install process and requirements will constantly change. Many thanks again to @kinoushe for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | LXDE: Resolved several issues due to conflicts between the RPi desktop LXDE packages with native LXDE.
- DietPi-Software | Webmin: Worked around an issue where install failed. Webmin depends on apt-show-versions which does not support compressed APT list files, which be implemented as default with DietPi v6.32.
- DietPi-Software | WebIOPi: Resolved an issue where the download failed.
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Resolved an issue where install failed on ARM due to missing new build dependency. Many thanks to @pbutterworth for reporting and @novitibo for providing the solution: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/home-assistant-404-error/4471
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: Resolved an issue on Odroid XU4 where install failed due to missing librockchip-mpp1 package which instead was aimed to be installed on Odroid N1 only.
- DietPi-Software | TigerVNC+LXDE: Resolved an issue where lxappearance start ("Customize Look and Feel") hangs within TigerVNC sessions.
- DietPi-Software | Fail2Ban: Resolved an issue where the service could have failed to start due to a missing variable declaration in our default config. Many thanks to @mafioso12dk for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | DietPi-RAMlog: Resolved an issue where /var/log content was not restored when reinstalling DietPi-RAMlog, e.g. when switching logging mode from #1 to #2. This could have led to service start issues, when those rely on log files or directories being present. Many thanks to @djashdj for reporting this issue.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3829

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.32
(31/08/20)

API Changes:
- DietPi-Set_swapfile | Running the script without input arguments does not print the current swap file location and size anymore but will apply the settings stored in dietpi.txt, refresh the current swap file or apply defaults as fallback. Currently active swap files can be reliably checked via /proc/swaps or htop.

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- NanoPi NEO3 | Initial support for this SBC has been added.
- NanoPi R2S | Initial support for this SBC has been added.
- NanoPi K2 | Initial support for this SBC has been added.
- DietPi-Set_swapfile | Added support for zram-based swap space. Use "zram" as swap location to have a zram device created (persistently via udev rule) at /dev/zram0 and used for compressed in-memory swap space. The auto-size option "1" will result in a zram size of 50% of physical RAM size, else the MiB value will be used, as long as its smaller than physical RAM size. Many thanks to @rickalm for pushing this topic with an initial implementation: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3705
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | For NTFS mounts, the "big_writes" mount option is now added by default, which reduces CPU load and by this may increase performance. Many thanks to @balexandrov for suggesting this enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3330#issuecomment-654072107
- DietPi-Config | Added selection of schedutil and user space CPU frequency governors. Schedutil is a modern dynmic governor which sets frequency tightly related and according to metrics of the CPU scheduling driver itself. Userspace is a no-op governor, i.e. it does not touch CPU frequencies at all which allows setting manual/custom frequencies according to own metrics or via scripts. Read more about native Linux CPU frequency scaling: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/pm/cpufreq.html#generic-scaling-governors
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Removed the option to switch the deprecated max_usb_current setting in config.txt. Max USB current is now enabled by default via firmware on all RPi models: https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/issues/1655
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | Lighttpd: Updated our default SSL cipher to match newer standards, still intermediate and compatible with Debian Stretch (Lighttpd v1.4.45). Additionally our config file names have been adjusted to use lighty-enable|disable-mod and priority prefixes to allow ordering own custom configs/vhosts more easily around them. Many thanks to @PanosssD for making us aware of this: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3707
- DietPi-Software | Komga: FOSS home server for comics and mangas, now available for install as ID 179. Many thanks to @himura95 for providing the implementation: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3403
- DietPi-Software | Jellyfin: A FOSS web interface media streaming server available for install. Many thanks to all who voted for it: https://feathub.com/MichaIng/DietPi/+63
- DietPi-Software | Airsonic: It is now available on Debian Buster systems since Java 11 support has been added. Many thanks to @linxiaopi for pointing us at the required re-evaluation: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3732
- DietPi-Software | On the uninstall information prompt, the info has been added that uninstalling usually means that related userdata and configs are purged as well. Additionally "dietpi-software reinstall <ID>" is mentioned now as alternative to repair/update installed software. Many thanks to @kpine for doing this request: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3550
- DietPi-Software | Python pip: We migrated this software selection to a Python 3/pip3 install only, due to Python 2 being end of life since 2020/01. Where possible, dependant software selections have been migrated to Python3 builds, where not possible, Python2/pip2 is installed separately for now. We hope that most affected software titles will do Python3 releases soon, otherwise we will remove them form our portfolio, at latest in spring 2021. The strongest reason for this is that next Debian Bullseye (summer 2021) will not ship Python2 packages anymore.
- DietPi-Software | SABnzbd: Migrated to a Python3-based install.
- DietPi-Software | OctoPrint: On Debian Buster and up, migrated to a Python3-based install.
- DietPi-Software | WordPress: Plugins can now be installed and the internal updater used OOTB without the need to manually apply correct file permissions first. Many thanks to @Joulinar for implementing this: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3720
- DietPi-Software | ProFTPD: On fresh installs, reverse DNS lookups are disabled by default now by adding "UseReverseDNS off" to /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf. This increases login speeds, in case dramatically, depending on reverse DNS server. Additionally file uploads can now be resumed by default via "AllowStoreRestart On" and members of the "dietpi" group have write access to uploaded files ("Umask 002") to increase OOTB compatibility with media and file sharing software. Many thanks to @bbsixzz for doing these suggestions: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3727
- DietPi-Software | HTPC Manager: Migrated to a Python3-compatible fork initiated by @gmiranda (https://github.com/HTPC-Manager/HTPC-Manager), since the previous fork stopped development. Please help test, and when possible contribute to this project to keep it alive. We'll do minimal tests and assure the basic install and web interface works fine from Debian Stretch till Debian Bullseye.

Bug Fixes:
- General | Resolved an issue where enabling or disabling IPv6 removed the expected symlink at /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf with its actual target file. This happened when using dietpi-config network options and as well during firstrun setup when dietpi.txt choices are applied. The symlink is recreated, if missing, on all DietPi systems with next update.
- General | Resolved an external bug where the haveged entropy daemon failed to start on some ARM boards with the current version shipped with Debian Buster. On Buster ARMv7 and ARMv8 systems, a new package from Debian Bullseye is installed with this DietPi update, which contains the upstream fix: https://github.com/jirka-h/haveged/pull/7
- DietPi-Benchmark | Resolved an issue where file system benchmarks failed. Many thanks to @dbambus for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3672
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where RPi onboard Bluetooth is attempted to be enabled on RPi models without onboard Bluetooth. On those models, now only the generic Bluetooth packages and services are installed and enabled. Many thanks to @TASSDevon for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3611
- DietPi-Software | Node.js: Resolved an issue where the installer internet connection check fails due to new nodejs.org HTTPS redirection. For now we use our own fork.
- DietPi-Software | HTPC Manager: Resolved an issue where install failed due to missing build-essential dependency.
- DietPi-Software | HTPC Manager: Resolved an issue where the internal updater failed due to missing git meta files.
- DietPi-Software | EmonPi: Resolved a failing primary UART activation on install.
- DietPi-Software | PHP: Resolved an issue where on pre-v6.23 systems the PHP upgrade from v7.0/7.1 to v7.2/7.3 did not work as expected. Many thanks to @illusive-c for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3670
- DietPi-Software | Xfce: Resolved an issue where the install and autostart of xcompmgr composition manager broke the xfwm4 internal one, leading to ineffective appearance settings and black borders around windows in certain cirumstances. Many thanks to @TamaTamaGoGo for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3665
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Resolved an issue with Apache webserver, where CORS check failed if the Referrer-Policy header has been set to "no-referrer". If this is the case, the Pi-hole Apache config now sets it to the second strict "same-origin", which does not break the Pi-hole admin panel. Many thanks to @Phil1988 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3675
- DietPi-Software | qBittorrent: Resolved an issue where setting the web UI port via config file or UI is overridden by the service file command option. Many thanks to @linxiaopi for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3660
- DietPi-Software | Fail2Ban: Resolved an issue where sshd filter modes could not be set via jail config since the variable was not passed. Many thanks to @Darwolia for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3697
- DietPi-Software | Cuberite: Resolved an install issue due to changed download URL and worked around a startup issue on RPi 1/Zero models since Cuberite dropped ARMv6 support. Many thanks to @CactiChameleon9 for providing compatible binaries: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3664

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3751

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.31
(05/07/20)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- RPi | Support for Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) has been added, including any other Debian pre-image on RPi. Many thanks to @FusionPlmH for doing this request: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3570
- Odroid C4 | Support for this new Hardkernel SBC has been added to allow image creation based on Meveric's Odroid repository, including Kodi support.
- Network | "ping" can now be used by all users without any file capabilities, sudo or setuid. For this we allow all users to create native ICMP sockets which are available since Linux 3.X but disabled by default on Debian. Other distributions and systemd (upstream) have this enabled by default and for security and usability reasons we follow them: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/EnableSysctlPingGroupRange
- DietPi-Login | A new setting has been added which allows to skip the interactive GPLv2 license agreement on first login. Add/set "AUTO_SETUP_ACCEPT_LICENSE=1" in (/boot/)dietpi.txt in which case we assume you read and agreed the license text at least once. Many thanks to @mrbluecoat for reporting the urgent use-case of Chromium kiosk mode autostart without keyboard attached: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3326
- DietPi-Cleaner | Enhanced performance of the files cleaner if /mnt is skipped, especially in combination with large drives or network mounts. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for revealing the underlying issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3609
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | SSHFS entries in fstab are now detected and preserved. Many thanks to @notwork for doing this suggestion.
- DietPi-Config | Added Ethernet link speed selection to Network>Ethernet menu. The function and dietpi.txt entry exists for a long time but it was only exposed as first run setup option.
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard: Added generic support for all SBCs where the WireGuard kernel module is shipped together with the kernel package. This applies to most current Armbian-based images at the time of writing and will be the more regular case since Linux 5.6 has WireGuard natively integrated.
- DietPi-Software | Firefox Sync Server has been added to our software list, which allows to sync your Firefox bookmarks, history, tabs and passwords via your self-hosted server. Many thanks and all credits to @CedArctic for implementing this software title: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3471
- DietPi-Software | Folding@Home: Updated to latest v7.6.X, which includes an explicit option for prioritising COVID 19 projects: https://foldingathome.org/2020/04/17/new-foldinghome-software-with-the-option-to-prioritize-covid-19-projects/
                                  This update is applied to all systems with DietPi v6.31, existing config and data are preserved.
- DietPi-Software | Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr: The /media directory as second common mount point can now also be used as download/media directory without manually adding it to the systemd units ReadWritePaths list. Many thanks to @ricardoandren for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3561
- DietPi-Software | Samba Server: Changed default server-side file permissions from 0775 to 0664, hence files on the server are by default created without execute permissions now, which suits usual standards. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3581
- DietPi-Software | QuiteRSS: Re-added the years ago accidentally removed install code block. If you ever wondered why there was no QuiteRSS after selecting it for install, now there will be. If it is marked as installed already, run either "dietpi-software install 22" or simply "apt install quiterss" to (really) get it.
- DietPi-Software | Squeezelite: Updated to v1.9.7 and the service runs now as own user "squeezelite". Many thanks to @volpone for doing the update request: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2386

Bug Fixes:
- System | Resolved potential issues due to missing /media directory on DietPi images, which is not used by default but is part of FHS and can hence be expected by Linux software, e.g. htpdate. Many thanks to @jokoren for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3558
- DietPi-Login | Resolved an issue where the script called itself from within the error handler subshell. Generally the error handler subshell must never call dietpi-login (and related autostart programs) and dietpi-login must never call itself from an interactive subshell. Many thanks to @nosyaardvark for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3583#issuecomment-643583664
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where moving the RootFS to an external drive did not include DietPi userdata. Many thanks to @sdomotica and @Joulinar for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3600#issuecomment-643261670
- DietPi-LED_control | Resolved an issue where LED triggers fail to become boot persistent. Many thanks to @FrostyMisa for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3636

- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on RPi4 2/4/8 GiB RAM models where the current GPU memory split was not obtained correctly. Many thanks to @FrostyMisa for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3636#issuecomment-652467249
- DietPi-Software | Logging choice: Resolved an issue where manually choosing logging options "None" and "Full" during firstrun installs did not uninstall DietPi-RAMlog as intended. Many thanks to @Pain-Patate for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3588
- DietPi-Software | GMediaRender+WireGuard: Resolved an issue where service start could have failed due to invalid network information. Many thanks to @fnsnyc for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3519
- DietPi-Software | rTorrent: Resolved an issue where startup fails because of invalid default config values. Many thanks to @PiTech and @vorrac for reporting and fixing this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr: Resolved an issue where those software services crashed once an hour due to faulty SQLite database log file clearing. Many thanks to @Taloth from Sonarr and all the others who reported, investigated and finally solved the mystery.
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard: Resolved an issue where WireGuard in client mode failed to start due to missing resolvconf. It is now installed together with WireGuard when choosing client setup. Many thanks to @yahoo456 for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard: Worked around an issue where on some Odroids install failed due to missing symlinks to the Linux headers. Many thanks to @repomanz for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3577
- DietPi-Software | Ubooquity: Updated the installer to pull the latest version from Vae Mendis Software directly and enhanced permissions to better integrate with other software. Many thanks to @Mr.Roboto for doing this suggestion.

v6.30
(10/05/20 Hotfix)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- DietPi-Software | qBittorrent: Changed default download file permissions so that Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr/.. are able to manipulate the downloads after import. Many thanks to @compdealer for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3524

Bug Fixes:
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where on RPi3/4/Zero W onboard WiFi could not be enabled. Many thanks to @dasrocky for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3510
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue on Raspberry Pi where, after running DietPi-Drive_Manager, the root file system was mount read-only. Many thanks to @Adsouza98 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3511
- DietPi-Banner | Resolved an issue where non-root users were unable to download a new MOTD (message of the day). Many thanks to @PeterLacknase and @fnsnyc for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3505, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3520
- DietPi-Boot | Resolved an issue where non-root users were unable to read or update DietPi-internal network info, which lead to e.g. error messages on login. Many thanks to @PeterLacknase for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3505
- DietPi-Update | Resolved an issue where on DietPi pre-v6.16 system some DietPi scripts were accidentally removed during update. Many thanks to @Vec7or and @littis for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3509, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3513

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.29
(03/05/20)

API Changes:
- Hardware info | The hardware info file /DietPi/dietpi/.hw_model should be now accessed at /boot/dietpi/.hw_model (see DietPi-RAMdisk removal below) and contains info now as NAME=VALUE like lines, which can be sourced from shell scripts.
- Flag/Info files | /DietPi/dietpi/.update_available, /DietPi/dietpi/.timesync_exit_status, /DietPi/dietpi/.network and /tmp/.dietpi_motd have all been moved into a new runtime directory: /run/dietpi/
- DietPi-Globals | The global variables G_HW_ARCH_DESCRIPTION and G_HW_MODEL_DESCRIPTION have been renamed to G_HW_ARCH_NAME and G_HW_MODEL_NAME. The new variables G_HW_UUID (DietPi-internal device UUID) and G_ROOTFS_DEV (RootFS device path) are available. On RPi additionally G_HW_REVISION, G_HW_PCB_REVISION, G_HW_MEMORY_SIZE and G_HW_MANUFACTURER are available, the revision code and its decoded information: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#raspberry-pi-revision-codes
- DietPi-Globals | G_RUN_CMD and G_ERROR_HANDLER have been removed and replaced with G_EXEC. Basically G_EXEC can be used the same way G_RUN_CMD was before and it is wider configurable to make manual G_ERROR_HANDLER usage obsolete where custom solution menu entries or command output parsing is required, e.g. to check for errors that do not produce exit codes. Visual change for regular DietPi users is that every error handled command can be retried, a subshell can be opened to investigate or fix the originating issue and, for experienced users, the command can be altered, e.g. if a download link has changed or an expected file has been moved manually to a new path. Further details can be found in the script: /boot/dietpi/func/dietpi-globals
- DietPi-Globals | G_FILE_EXISTS has been removed, as it was used only a single time in our code and usually it needs to be checked and handled explicitly, whether it is a file, directory, symlink with or without existing target.
- DietPi-Globals | The new global functions G_CHECK_CON and G_CHECK_DNS have been added to test general network connectivity and DNS resolver based on dietpi.txt settings.

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- NanoPi M4V2 | Initial hardware identifier (ID: 58) and support for this device has been added to DietPi. Many thanks to @purist doing this request.
- NanoPi NEO Plus2 | Initial hardware identifier (ID: 57) and support for this device has been added to DietPi. Many thanks to @StephanStS for doing this request and creating an image: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2979#issuecomment-615487662
- PINE H64 | Initial hardware identifier (ID: 45) and support for this device has been added to DietPi. Many thanks to @unixino for doing this request: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3286
- ROCK Pi S | Initial hardware identifier (ID: 73) and support for this device has been added to DietPi. Many thanks to @lwqcz for doing this request: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3365
- Sparky SBC | Updated kernel drivers and SBC-specific service and config files
- General | Switched to C.UTF-8 as default locale and for DietPi scripts. It is shipped statically by APT package, international and more lightweight compared to en_GB.UTF-8.
- DietPi-RAMdisk | Removed from DietPi, which means that one can edit config files in /boot directory directly now. To keep performance for our scripts up, vmtouch is installed instead, which allows to lock files in native file system cache, configured to lock /boot/dietpi and /boot/dietpi.txt in cache by default. More info: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3288
- DietPi-LED_control | LED trigger choices are now applied via udev rules, existing settings are migrated on DietPi-Update. This allows to skip running this script at boot and simplify the preboot script, which both reduces boot time a bid. Additionally, applied LED triggers can now be reset to system defaults, which removes related udev rules. Since the script is now for interactive usage only, it has been moved to /boot/dietpi/dietpi-led_control and an alias has been added to call it from console via "dietpi-led_control" command.
- DietPi-Update | The DietPi auto update feature has been removed. Our updates require users attention, they often contain deeper changes, interactive elements and important information. We'll instead add an auto APT upgrade feature at a later release, similar to "unattended-upgrades" but with the possibility to also upgrade non-security patches, right into dietpi-update. Checking for available updates is done as before on a daily basis if not disabled via dietpi.txt.
- DietPi-Cron | Allows now to set the cron job output mail recipient. Cron mails are disabled by default since no MTA is preconfigured on DietPi. Additionally the execution times are now shown more clearly in 24h format.
- DietPi-AutoStart | When selecting a non-root autologin user, some required tasks, like permissions, are now applied automatically, based on autostart option. This especially allows non-root users to launch Kodi without applying permissions manually. Many thanks to @sbrl for requesting this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3351
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | GlusterFS fstab entries are now preserved. Many thanks to @Sudrien for implementing this addition: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3374
- DietPi-Software | Domoticz: open-source home automation platform is now available for install. Many thanks to @AndyB for doing this request a long time ago: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/software-suggestion-domoticz/185
- DietPi-Software | phpBB: Updated to v3.3.0 which has PHP7.3 support, hence can be installed on all hardware models and distro versions.
- DietPi-Software | Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr: Enhanced install and uninstall steps. On reinstalls, the install directory is left unchanged now, suggesting to use the internal updater instead, which is generally safer and now does not require a manual service restart (see bug fix below). In case of a broken instance, the install directory /opt/<name> needs to be removed manually now, to have reinstalls downloading and installing the newest binaries.
- DietPi-Software | Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr: The service now runs with hardened permissions, by default blocking access to directories outside of /opt/<name> /mnt /var/log/<name> and /tmp. If writing to other directories is wanted, the service file needs to be edited, easiest with "dietpi-services" > "<name>" > "Edit" and adding an additional "ReadWritePaths=/path/to/custom/dir".
- DietPi-Software | Chromium: Unlocked install on ARMv6 RPi models: RPi1/Zero/Zero W. Browsing performance will not be perfect, but for kiosk mode or light usage there are use cases. Many thanks to @kmplngj for requesting and testing: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3364
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: Updated installer according to next upstream release v6.2.0. Many thanks to @jcorporation for informing us about the new version: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3382
- DietPi-Software | MPD: Assured that UNIX domain socket and systemd unit for socket activation is present on Stretch systems. As well the obsolete cache directory symlinks in "/var/lib/mpd" will not be present anymore. Any custom scripts must use the absolute paths in "/mnt/dietpi_userdata/.mpd_cache" from now on.
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Enabled support for Pi-hole v5. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting the required change: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3391
- DietPi-Software | Shairport Sync: Updated to new version 3.3.6, using self-compiled deb packages. Many thanks to @kmplngj for doing this request: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3216
- DietPi-Software | HAProxy: Updated to newest stable upstream version 2.1.3 and the sysvinit service has been replaced with the officially provided systemd service. It will be reinstalled on all systems via DietPi-Update, your config files will not be touched on any reinstall.
- DietPi-Software | rTorrent: Further rework and update of the default config file. Many thanks to @bbsixzz for this contribution: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3332

Bug Fixes:
- Raspberry Pi | Resolved an issue where RPi models could be incorrectly identified in case of warranty, overvoltage or OTP bits set in revision code. Many thanks to @FusionPlmH for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2979#issuecomment-598906749
- DietPi-Banner | Resolved an issue where clearing the screen fails due to missing G_TERM_CLEAR command. Many thanks to @Joulinar for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3313
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where, on RPi with vc4-fkms-v3d overlay/driver enabled, soundcard selection went wrong. Many thanks to @Cybolic for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3356
- DietPi-Globals | CPU temperature readout on Intel Mini PCs has been fixed. Many thanks to @BrownC0de and @0x9394 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3172, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3412
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where the chosen spindown timeout was not applied correctly on boot. Many thanks to @tesseract241 and @lukaszm89 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3309, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3420
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where NFS pre-v3 mounts could have failed on boot. They are now automounted on first mountpoint access, like NFSv3 and Samba shares do already. Many thanks to @Joulinar for reporting and debugging this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1898#issuecomment-604412425
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where Samba/SMB/CIFS mounts failed if the shares name contained white spaces. Many thanks to @SNG for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where extraction of zip archives to current directory failed. Many thanks to @en0rism for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3320
- DietPi-Software | Redis: Resolved an issue where service start fails on Stretch systems. Many thanks to @drieksje for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3314
- DietPi-Software | Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr: Resolved an issue where a manual service restart was required after the internal updater has been used.
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: Resolved MPD connection issues on Stretch systems. Many thanks to @jcorporation for informing us on upstream changes, helping with debug and fixing the issues: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3382
- DietPi-Software | O!MPD: Resolved an issue where YouTube support was not functional by default due to missing youtube-dl execute permissions. Many thanks to @ArturSierzant for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3413
- DietPi-Software | GMediaRender: Resolved an issue where the wrong sound device could have been used. Many thanks to @gaeldoyen for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3348
- DietPi-Software | Chromium: Resolved an issue where non-root users were not able to use the Chromium autostart option due to wrong permissions. Many thanks to @lasers and @promofu for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3322
- DietPi-Software | RPi Cam Web Interface: Resolved an issue where camera through the web UI failed because of missing permissions. Many thanks to @arkhub for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3431
- DietPi-Software | OctoPrint: Resolved an issue where install failed. Many thanks to @zell-mbc and @Joulinar for reporting the issue and providing the solution: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3474
- DietPi-Software | Koel: Resolved an issue where download failed because of changed GitHub link. Many thanks to @C-Fu and @Joulinar for reporting and identifying the issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3482

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.28
(03/01/20 Hotfix)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: The new homeassistant-update.sh script, for quickly updating your Home Assistant version, now gets execute permissions on install.

Bug Fixes:
- System | Resolved an issue were the chosen CPU governor was not applied correctly. Many thanks to @bbsixzz for reporting the issue and @Joulinar for providing the solution: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3299
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue were zip archive extraction failed. Many thanks to @dcallen7 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3300
- DietPi-Software | phpMyAdmin: Resolved an issue where reinstalls failed if phpMyAdmin was installed prior DietPi v6.27 with Lighttpd or Nginx as webserver. Many thanks to @Nightliss for reporting the issue and @Joulinar for providing the solution: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3304
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Resolved an issue where the service failed to start if prior to reinstall the data directory permissions were not set correctly. Many thanks to @huettenwirt for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3219#issuecomment-570582486

Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3310

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.27
(01/01/20)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- FriendlyELEC ZeroPi | Initial hardware identifier (ID: 59) and support for this device has been added to DietPi. Many thanks to @Stephan for creating the related DietPi image: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3221
- RPi | An updated USBridgeSig Ethernet driver, as provided by allo.com, will be applied via postinst kernel script, until it has been merged into official RPi kernel: https://github.com/allocom/USBridgeSig/tree/master/ethernet
- RPi4 | Added generic RPi4 revision code detection to include the new revisions [abc]03112 and potential new PCB v1.3 til v1.9 once released. Many thanks to @Joulinar for reporting the missing new revision code: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3257#issuecomment-565370856
- RPi4 | Since RPi4, bootloader and USB firmware is stored on an internal EEPROM, which is not updated/flashed by the firmware APT package installs automatically. The additional "rpi-eeprom" package comes with an EEPROM update script and boot service, which will now be installed on DietPi update and firstrun setup automatically, if RPi4 is detected. Those firmware updates include power consumption (hence heat emission) optimisations and enable additional boot methods, currently network boot and USB boot is planned as well. This was reason enough for us to implement it automatically for all RPi4 systems. Additionally you can actively install/update the EEPROM manually via dietpi-config > Advanced Options > Update RPi4 EEPROM firmware. For additional information, read the official docs: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#raspberry-pi-boot-eeprom. Many thanks to @trueaspects for informing us about this important subject: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3217
- Virtual Machines | Intel/AMD CPU microcode update packages are not installed/purged from virtual machines. The CPU is provided by the host, hypervisors do not allow to update microcode from within the guest, reasonably, and if they did, this would be serious security and stability issue.
- DietPi-Globals | A new function G_TERM_CLEAR has been added to clear a current terminal view by moving content into scrollback buffer. The previous method erased current visible content on some terminal types. Many thanks to @rdslw for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1615#issuecomment-562928032
- DietPi-PREP | New images will have all man pages and documentation files for installed packages available. Those were removed until now, but prevented users from simply installing man-db to view man pages on the system, without reinstalling packages to restore those first. Many thanks to @smudgered for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3259
- DietPi-Software | The general network check against first sources.list entry has been replaced by a pure connectivity test and separate DNS resolver test via ping. This solves an issue where sources.list parsing failed when [arch=...] was specified and allows better debugging. The sources list entries themselves are checked and error-handled by G_AGUP already. Ping target IP for connection test and domain for DNS resolver test can be set via dietpi.txt, default is Cloudflare DNS IP and domain which should be very reliable and fast all over the world. Many thanks to @lwqcz for reporting the issue and providing a solution: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3243
- DietPi-Software | TasmoAdmin: The administrative website to manage ESP8266 devices flashed with Tasmota for smart home systems is now available for install. Many thanks to @svh1985 for implementing this software title: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3103
- DietPi-Software | ownCloud: Enabled install on Buster, Bullseye and ARMv6 RPi models (RPi1+Zero). ownCloud 10.3 has been release with PHP7.3 support, hence it can be used with native distro PHP7.3 and does not require Ondrej's PHP repo which does not support armv6hf.
- DietPi-Software | Syncthing: Enhanced service by security hardenings and to allow internal updates and auto updates without failing to restart. Moved binary from /etc/syncthing to /opt/syncthing to match FHS and disabled file logging, which is an unnecessary overhead, since logs can be easily viewed via "journalctl -u syncthing". Changes will be applied to all installs on v6.27 update, existing configs won't be touched by this.
- DietPi-Software | NAA daemon: Latest version is now scraped from base URL and installed automatically. Many thanks to @Heroldgray for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3191
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Python3.8 will be installed for the pyenv from now on due to Python3.6 deprecation. Many thanks to @sdomotica for providing this information: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3219
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: When selecting for install, one will be informed about possibly long install/build times. Many thanks to @Gill-Bates for doing this suggestion to avoid users assuming their install process being stuck: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2897
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Vastly reduced Home Assistant dependencies and install complexity. It does not run inside a virtualenv of pyenv anymore, since it has already its unique pyenv Python instance. pyenv is still required due to the large amount of specific module versions, required for HA and its integrations. The alternative would be a venv from a globally installed Python instance, but this requires further thoughts and discussion. The amount of development libraries and tools, installed via APT, has been updated and reduced to a minimum to build Python and Home Assistant inside the pyenv without errors and warnings. There is a slightly increased chance that certain HA components need additional development packages. To cover this, two new settings have been added to dietpi.txt: "SOFTWARE_HOMEASSISTANT_APT_DEPS" and "SOFTWARE_HOMEASSISTANT_PIP_DEPS". Add a space-separated list of APT packages and pip modules respectively, to have those installed automatically with Home Assistant. As well activating the pyenv environment from console is now easier possible via "source /home/homeassistant/pyenv-activate.sh" as user "homeassistant". Additionally "/home/homeassistant/homeassistant-update.sh" has been added, which can be called by any sudo-capable user to update Home Assistant easily.
- DietPi-Software | Node-RED: Access permissions to I2C is now enabled by default on RPi and other SBCs which ship a configured "i2c" group by default. Many thanks to @NastySpill for reporting an underlying issue.
- DietPi-Software | Gitea: The latest version will now be pulled from GitHub automatically.
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Updated to v3.0.9, a large update from v2.25 with many improvements, see: https://github.com/midwan/amiberry/releases
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Since we ship a tailored SDL2 version, this has now been merged right into the Amiberry download archive and install directory, to not interfere with other system-wide installed SDL2 instances.
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: Add GPU-accelerated support for Odroid N2 via fbdev driver and special Kodi build, provided by Meveric. Many thanks to @ernero93 for doing this request: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3255
- DietPi-Software | Koel: The latest upstream release will be pulled automatically now, v4.2.2 at date of writing. Dependencies have been updated accordingly, e.g. latest Koel supports latest Node.js v13.5.0.
- DietPi-Software | NoMachine: Updated to latest version 6.9.2 and switched to URL with no version string, which allows us to update downloads on-the-fly without code changes. Download URLs from official website have been simplified and follow some logic, but there are no "latest" URLs available and older versions are not kept, hence we must go on hosting those packages on dietpi.com.
- DietPi-Software | Allo web UI: Updated to version 13.1, which mostly fixes some compatibility issues with DietPi v6.27 and Debian Buster systems. For details, see: /var/www/allo/CHANGELOG.txt
- DietPi-Software | phpMyAdmin: The APT package install has been replaced by an upstream archive download. This allows us to ship the most current version on all distro versions and avoids incompatibility due to PHP meta packages being pulled as dependencies by the APT package. Install on Buster and Bullseye is possible now by this and incompatibility with concurrent ownCloud and phpBB has been resolved. On Stretch this resolves an issue due to new PHP7.4 being pulled by "php" meta package from Ondrejs repo. Many thanks to @symlagom for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3284

Bug Fixes:
- DietPi-PREP | Resolved an issue, where in rare cases a wrong $PATH variable could break command calls. Many thanks to @dtm2001 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3206
- DietPi-Explorer | Resolved an issue where handling of file/directory paths with white spaces failed. Many thanks to @gabboman for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where, after transferring the root file system, the script itself could revert the fstab entry, since a reboot was not forced anymore since v6.22. This change has been reverted, hence a reboot cannot be skipped to avoid any fstab revert and inconsistency with cmdline. Many thanks to @DutchFlash for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where, in rare cases, all drives were mounted as R/O on boot. Many thanks to @samolego for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3268
- DietPi-AutoStart | Resolved an issue where non-interactive script calls, e.g. done by dietpi-software installs, reset prior made auto login user choices. Many thanks to @zedrdave for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3242
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Resolved an issue where PSU noise reduction state always shows "[Off]". HDMI output will now be toggled immediately, hence no reboot is required for changes to take effect. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3187
- DietPi-Software | ownCloud/Nextcloud: An important security fix has been applied to our ownCloud/Nextcloud Nginx configs. This has been merged into our other GitHub branches as well, hence all fresh installs wont be affected. Read more about it: https://nextcloud.com/blog/urgent-security-issue-in-nginx-php-fpm/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.26
(15/10/19)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- General | Support for Debian Jessie has now been fully dropped from DietPi code. Jessie systems are moved to the "jessie-support" Git branch and will stay on v6.25. Critical bugs, if reported, may still be fixed, but DietPi-Software related issues and new features will not be handled anymore by the DietPi code team. However, everyone is free to open pull requests against the jessie-support branch: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/tree/jessie-support
- General | Initial support and definitions for Debian Bullseye, the new Debian testing version, have been added to DietPi code. You can now create Bullseye systems via DietPi-PREP: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3009
- General | DietPi scripts, i.e. dietpi-software, will not overwrite you custom permissions in /mnt/dietpi_userdata anymore. Instead required permissions are now only applied for individual software titles that are being installed. Besides saving you time to re-apply custom permission, this as well enhances security in some cases where software installers/archives apply/contain stricter per-file/dir permissions. Many thanks to @JJGO and @johnvick for suggesting this enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2641
- General | On first boot, when DietPi-Software finishes the initial setup, it is now assured that all APT packages, including firmware, are upgraded by performing an "apt-get dist-upgrade"/"apt full-upgrade". Since it includes upgrades regardless of underlying dependency and conflict changes, which in rare cases can perform unwanted removals, we do not do this on regualar DietPi-Update/Software runs. But on first boot, without additional packages installed yet, it is safe. Many thanks to @cmessin1 for doing this request: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3098
- Rockchip | Experimental GPU acceleration support for RK3399 SoCs and ASUS Tinker Board has been re-enabled.
- RPi | The haveged daemon has been replaced with rng-tools, an alternative which does not work on all devices, but has been proven to work on RPi, is default on Raspbian and uses less RAM on idle.
- RPi4 | The default CPU temperature limit (temp_limit) has been raised from 65°C to 75°C, since this device runs significantly hotter then previous RPi model. Many thanks to @trueaspects and @Trunkzeh for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3019, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3151
- DietPi-Globals | The environment variable $G_USER_INPUTS has been renamed to $G_INTERACTIVE, which describes better what it does. When setting this to "0", DietPi scripts will run non-interactively, i.e. all whiptail dialog prompts and other tasks that require manual user input are skipped. Note that this is not required when running scripts from cron jobs or systemd units, since those have no STDIN attached which makes DietPi scripts run non-interactively automatically. Scripts will stay backwards-compatible, thus respect $G_USER_INPUTS for a while, but please adjust your scripts or docs where you make use of it. Many thanks to @AtkLordOverAll for contributing this change: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3041
- DietPi-PostBoot | /var/log/boottime is not created anymore. Please use "systemd-analyze" to get much more accurate and detailed boot information.
- DietPi-PostBoot | The pre-login banner has been slightly adjusted: Default login credentials are now only shown on first boot, since the information is obsolete when user changed the password. As well an info has been added that one needs to hit <return> to show the username input field.
- DietPi-Banner/NordVPN: DietPi-NordVPN has a new input command to print the current VPN connection state: "dietpi-nordvpn status". This has been implemented as well into DietPi-Banner to optionally show NordVPN connection state on login automatically. Many thanks to @svh1985 for implementing this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3084
- DietPi-NordVPN | Added options for connection up/down scripts, e.g. to implement killswitches, answer inbound connections from outside local network correctly, safe and track connection uptime, and similar tasks. Many thanks to @svh1985 for implementing this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3047
- DietPi-Config | Audio Options: Menu has been reworked. Audio capabilities (ALSA) can be enabled and disabled as a separate option. If enabled, generic sound card auto-detection has been added to the bottom of the list for all devices. This allows the selection of generic sound devices on all SBCs, e.g. if unknown to DietPi or if our hard-coded card/device IDs are wrong due to additional attached audio hardware.
- DietPi-Config | Some /etc/modprobe.d/ configs are merged to less files and mostly prefixed with "dietpi-", to allow easier differentiation between Debian/pre-image and DietPi files.
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Update certain config.txt settings to match new firmware version. WiFi and Bluetooth is now disabled via related dtoverlays, which should further reduce hardware and firmware loads.
- DietPi-Config | Added overclocking profiles for RPi4. Many thanks to @aftensleuk for request and valuable suggestions.
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Re-added previously removed options to adjust initial turbo for CPU frequency on boot and to lower the idle CPU frequency. The related firmware issues have been fixed with a recent update: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3147
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Removed the option to adjust CPU frequency limits. On RPi the dynamic CPU governors only jump between "arm_freq" and "arm_freq_min", hence those limits should be set via overclocking profile and the newly re-added "ARM Idle Frequency" option.
- DietPi-Config | RPi1/Zero: OpenGL modes/drivers can now be successfully selected/installed from display resolution menu.
- DietPi-Software | TightVNC: Since Stretch, TightVNC has been replaced by TigerVNC, thus the install option has now been removed from code.
- DietPi-Software | SDL2: Since we ship a tailored build for Amiberry, the general install option for SDL2 has been removed, instead it will be installed/updated along with Amiberry. If you require SDL2 for any other purpose, please install the "libsdl2-2.0.0" package from APT repository: https://packages.debian.org/libsdl2
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Logging to /var/log/pihole.log is now disabled by default, since it is not required in usual cases. Query logs, shown in web UI, are stored in database. This might also resolve possible pihole-FTL crashes in combination with DietPi-RAMlog and DietPi-Logclear. Many thanks to @kuerious for reporting and @Mcat12 for providing helpful information on this topic: https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL/issues/614
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Webserver configs have been added to block public access to the blocking page, optionally as well to the admin panel and generally block access to dot files/dirs (.git*) inside the admin panel directory. Parts are inspired by the official Lighttpd config, provided by Pi-hole: https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/advanced/lighttpd.conf.debian
                             Many thanks to @AtkLordOverAll for his effort to implement this for Lighttpd initially + the choice during install to block public admin panel access as well: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3054
- DietPi-Software | OpenVPN: Rsyslog is not installed anymore together with OpenVPN server. Logs are available via "journalctl -u openvpn", all system logs via "journalctl". If you require persistent logs, uninstall DietPi-RAMlog via dietpi-software and make the journal boot persistent via: mkdir /var/log/journal
- DietPi-Software | Gogs: On ARMv7 and x86_64 now the latest version from GitHub is installed. Reinstalls will upgrade the version while preserving existing settings. Many thanks to @LazyLama for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2999
- DietPi-Software | Webmin: Install is now done via official APT repository to allow easier updates. To apply this to all systems, it is reinstalled on DietPi-Update to v6.26. Additionally the dependency on rsyslog has been removed. The Webmin logging panel still depends on rsyslog, but the overhead shall not be applied to all systems by default. Instead users can now decide themselves, whether they need to see system logs on Webmin, or not, and in case apply custom logging settings as well.
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Enabled support for RPi4 and Odroid XU4. Thanks to @midwan for providing the binaries: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3104
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: Updated install steps to avoid deprecations of the current upstream version. As well the service will not run as primary group "dietpi" anymore, which is only required for software that creates media files. Many thanks to @jcorporation (developer of myMPD) for providing this information as well as a smooth build script that updates old instances gracefully: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3097
- DietPi-Software | WiFi Hotspot: Since on some systems, a hostapd service mask was found, it is now unmasked on install. As well our custom compiled binaries are now only installed on RTL8188C* devices where no special Realtek hostapd package is available. Many thanks to @symbios24 for reporting the service mask issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2962
- DietPi-Software | Fail2Ban is not handled by DietPi-Services anymore, since the brute-force protection shall stay active during updates, installs, backups etc. The service is now started by systemd on boot and stays active until shutdown. Additionally on fresh installs the default jail.conf is optimised for the set "route" ban action: "blackhole" is now the route type, which does not send any respond to blocked requests.
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard: Support for RPi1 + RPi Zero (ARMv6 models) has been enabled by switching to Bullseye as source repo, which is available for Raspbian as well. Additionally on RPi, the WireGuard kernel module is now rebuilt automatically after kernel package upgrades. Many thanks to @johnnyt83 for suggestion RPi1/Zero support and his efforts to test the source build: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2997
- DietPi-Software | Gitea: Version 1.9.4 will be shipped from now on. Many thanks to @msongz and @minhphuc429 for implementing this update: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3138, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3154
- DietPi-Software | Aria2: Runs now as it's own user "aria2" and group "dietpi" with home directory and config file moved to /mnt/dietpi_userdata/aria2/. Besides satisfying security standards, this allows other download and media related software, provided by dietpi-software, direct access to Aria2 downloads without the need for custom permission changes. Additionally the current session (download states) are saved on service stop and every 60 seconds, to prevent current tasks from being lost on reboot or power loss. Aria2 will be reinstalled with v6.26 to apply these changes. Many thanks to @msongz for implementing and testing the session feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3139

Bug Fixes:
- General | Removed an obsolete OpenMediaVault cron job and binary that was leftover on at least one of our images (NanoPi NEO2) and is not part of the current OMV packages, thus save to remove in every case. Many thanks to @kt1024 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2994
- General | Resolved an issue where install of required APT packages for certain scripts could fail in the rare case that APT lists are outdated and old packages are not available in the repo anymore. Many thanks to @Paulisper for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2996
- General | Resolved an issue on some Buster systems where console-setup fails on boot to apply keyboard layout and console settings. Many thanks to @jaxjexjox for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2912#issuecomment-532100542
- ROCK64/ROCKPro64 | Resolved an issue where DietPi could not obtain the active network adapter and IP, if onboard Ethernet was used. This is because of a kernel-related bug, which seems to cause Ethernet connection instabilities as well in cases. A workaround is applied to all new ROCK(Pro)64 images and via DietPi-Update. Many thanks to @svh1985 for reporting this issue, as well as searching and testing the workaround: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3066
- DietPi-Update | Resolved an issue where the script did not exit on error: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3127
- DietPi-Login | Resolved an issue during first run setup, where DietPi-Software was called with mostly wrong whiptail menu dimensions. This lead to info prompts and menus being quite small, in particular the "Install" menu entry, that one needs to select, being only visible when navigating to the bottom. Many thanks to @pbecks1963 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3053
- DietPi-NordVPN | Resolved an issue where the server menu could have wrong entries or even fail, if foreign files were placed inside the config directory. Many thanks to @svh1985 for reporting this issue and implementing a fix: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3047
- DietPi-Run_NTPD | Resolved an issue where changing time sync mode or mirror, from within time sync error prompt, led to a concurrent script execution. Many thanks to @Sopor for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3010
- DietPi-Services | Resolved an issue where single service calls failed if their names contain certain special characters, like dots. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3059
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on RPi where I2C baudrate was not applied correctly, thus selection was ineffective. Many thanks to @flashspys for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2966
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on RPi where headless mode did not disable all video outputs and framebuffer as intended, since the used config.txt setting has been removed with recent firmware versions.
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on RPi4 where SDTV/composite video output did not happen when selecting the related resolution menu entries.
- DietPi-Config | On RPi4, vc4-kms-v3d option has been removed from display resolution menu, since the full KMS driver is not supported on RPi4 currently.
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where the script tells you that SQLite will be installed as pre-req, while actually a desktop is required and LXDE will be installed.
- DietPi-Software | X11/Kodi on Odroid C2: Resolved an issue on Odroid C2 where Kodi failed to start. GPU drivers and X11 config will be updated during DietPi-Update to cover this issue. Many thanks to @alexeylutskov for reporting this issue and testing the fix: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3028
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: Resolved an issue where Kodi failed on RPi Buster and RPi4. Many thanks to @GulyFMG, @derdershat and @jonyskids for reporting this issue, searching and testing workarounds: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3031

- DietPi-Software | Node-RED: Resolved an issue where user creation fails if "gpio" group is not present. Many thanks to @marcobrianza for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2975#issuecomment-513917360
- DietPi-Software | OpenVPN: Resolved an issue where install failed on Debian Buster due to a new easy-rsa version with changed commands and options. Now the most recent easy-rsa is manually downloaded on all systems to generate server and client key + cert with modern methods and the client config is slightly updated to match modern settings.
- DietPi-Software | XRDP: On Stretch, new the version from backports is installed. This resolves a critical issue where /etc/profile was not loaded to the session and, due to incomplete $PATH variable, important system binaries were not available on terminal emulators which broke many install and upgrade tasks. Furthermore this resolves an issue where install and connection of XRDP failed if IPv6 was disabled. Many thanks to @aspinks for the debug session which allowed us to track the issue down to its root: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3017
- DietPi-Software | Sonarr: Resolved an issue where install failed due to an outdated APT repository key. Many thanks to @GregoryDosh and @GulyFMG for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3029
- DietPi-Software | Plex Media Server: Resolved an issue where DietPi-Update failed for versions prior to v6.23, due to the obsolete Plex Media Server dev2day repository being offline now. This repo is now removed via pre-patches, prior to G_AGUP being called. During regular patches PMS is reinstalled, applying the new official APT repo. Many thanks to @p-roman for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3038
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Resolved an issue, where the blocking page was only shown, if the blocked URL contained the domain only, without any appending path: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3072
- DietPi-Software | TigerVNC: Resolved an issue on Debian Buster, where the VNC connection fails immediately due to an external bug, if no read-only password has been applied via vncpasswd. Many thanks to @Trunkzeh for reporting this issue and providing the workaround: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3070
- DietPi-Software | TigerVNC: Resolved minor error messages on login and in logs: "No session for PID ...", "DE is (null); No desktop environment set, fallback to LXDE", "Use of uninitialized value $proto in socket at /usr/bin/tigervncserver"
- DietPi-Software | Netdata: Resolved an issue where install failed on Stretch systems. Many thanks to @Velociraptor85 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3062
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Resolved an issue where install failed on Buster due to changed library package version. The SDL2 library has been recompiled for Buster with minimal dependencies, thus X11 does not need to be installed anymore. Many thanks to @TuKo1982 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3104

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3162

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.25
(03/07/19)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- System | By default the "haveged" entropy daemon is now installed on all DietPi systems and patched with v6.25. It assures the pool of random bits /dev/random stays filled by using additional sources of randomness. This solves a bunch of issues, including hanging or very long boot times, very long service (re)starts or timeout failures and on Buster hanging network access. Especially affected is PHP7.3-FPM but as well VPN servers and WiFi hotspots and potentially many other network or cryptography related tasks. More information on this topic: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2806
- System | Initial RPi4 support has been added to the code and some other rare RPi models are now detected correctly by their revision codes. Note that a new Buster-based image is required to support RPi4 and further work on DietPi-Config to support new RPi4 features. Full support is expected with DietPi v6.26, testing images can be found here: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2935#issuecomment-506389899
- DietPi-FirstBoot | First boot setup steps have been moved into a separate script and systemd unit. This allows further cleanup of the regular boot process and more targeted debugging and development. Many thanks for @FredericGuilbault for implementing this enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2791
- DietPi-AutoStart | When choosing an autostart option that does not require a manual UNIX user login, the autologin user can now be chosen (which was always "root" previously). This can be applied automatically on firstrun setup with the new "AUTO_SETUP_AUTOSTART_LOGIN_USER" setting within dietpi.txt. If the user does not exist, is a system user (UID < 1000) or does not have a valid login shell, it will be reverted to root. Many thanks to @FredericGuilbault for suggesting this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2926
- DietPi-Globals | G_OBTAIN_CPU_TEMP(): Added support for Core2Duo CPU temperature to be printed on e.g. DietPi-Banner and "cpu" command output. Many thanks to @OstrovCity for posting the required information: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2563#issuecomment-494388278
- DietPi-Service 2.0 | Combines dietpi-process_tool into dietpi-services. Adds I/O policies, single/global service control and much more: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2786
- DietPi-Process_tool | Has been replaced with DietPi-Services. Existing saved options will no longer be available, please use 'dietpi-services' to apply required process_tool options with the upgraded system.
- DietPi-Explorer | Disabled opening of files in nano under select a file/folder mode.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Added the option to change the I/O scheduler per drive. Many thanks to @Generator for pointing us onto this topic: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2233
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Services are not stopped directly at start of this script any more. Instead this is done only on critical tasks, e.g. transferring of DietPi userdata, the swapfile or RootFS. Further increased navigation speed by re-running the drive detection loop only when affecting changes have been made, and, by several other code enhancements.
- DietPi-Config | APT Cache: We added new options to "dietpi-config" > "Advanced Options" > "APT Cache" to disable the APT cache or move cache, repo lists and/or package download directory to RAM. By default we disable the APT cache, which saves 50 - 100 MiB disk writes on each "apt-get update" call, but slows down "apt-cache" calls: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2840
- DietPi-Config | RTC mode: When selecting this option, a menu with additional info is shown instead of just toggling the state. Many thanks to @Sopor for this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2826
- DietPi-Config | Audio Options (RPi): I-Sabre-K2M/Q2M sound card drivers are now integrated into the RPi kernel. These are now enabled on selection instead of compiling the drivers from source: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2690
- DietPi-Software | Mycroft AI FOSS voice assistant is now available for install. Many thanks to @LexiconCode for the initial request and all other requesters, FeatHub voters and testers: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1701
- DietPi-Software | Resolved some misleading outputs when having VNC Server or GPU using software installed. Many thanks to @mtpiercey for reporting these issues: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2870
- DietPi-Software | Deluge: Lowered UMask (007 => 002) to allow read access from e.g. custom Samba shares without "dietpi" user. Many thanks to @radsb for reporting the limited access.
- DietPi-Software | FFmpeg: On RPi, the new APT repo package will be installed, which now supports RPi hardware acceleration and is some subversion newer then the package hosted on dietpi.com: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/869#issuecomment-490047405
- DietPi-Software | Gitea: Current stable v1.8.X will be installed now and existing instances will be upgraded during DietPi-Update. Many thanks to @msongz for implementing this: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2881
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: Current upstream version will be installed now and existing instances will be upgraded during DietPi-Update, which requires a config file reset. A backup to recover custom settings from will be created: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2156#issuecomment-497513129
- DietPi-Software | O!MPD: Current upstream version will be installed now and existing instances will be upgraded during DietPi-Update. Existing config and database will be preserved. YouTube and Tidal support is added now by default. Many thanks to @ArturSierzant for giving valuable feedback and suggestions: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2884
- DietPi-Software | Ampache: Reinstalls will now preserve existing configs and database.
- DietPi-Software | Medusa: mediainfo is now installed to enable Medusa gathering meta data and resolving related warnings in log. Additionally, on Stretch and above, Python3 is now installed and used, as recommended by Medusa for a while. Many thanks to @bluesmoke for suggesting this enhancement.
- DietPi-Software | Node-RED: "sudo" permissions are now enabled by default: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2910

Bug Fixes:
- Network | Resolved an issue where an unintended Ethernet/WiFi IP value was shown if no IP is assigned.
- DietPi-Boot | Waiting for network timer now includes the start of 'ifup' for the device. This is to speed up boot time by threading the ifup command and allowing the wait timer to be more accurate.
- DietPi-Login | Resolved an issue where login leads to immediate logout if DietPi scripts were not loaded to DietPi-RAMdisk location. Many thanks to @LexiconCode for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2841#issuecomment-494567292
- DietPi-Update | Resolved an issue where after update and reboot DietPi-Banner still shows update available with identical current and server versions.
- DietPi-Cleaner | Resolved an issue where the cleaner ran into an endless loop if "Files" cleaner was used. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2837

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.24
(15/05/19 Hotfix)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- DietPi-Software | Emby + Plex Server: Enabled access to DietPi network mounts and media files by default. Many thanks to @ilgrank for reporting this missing feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2801
- DietPi-Software | ownCloud + phpBB: Support had to be disabled on ARMv6 for now until we either find a way to install PHP7.2 (with all required modules) outside of sury.org (which does not support ARMv6) or those enable support for PHP7.3 (expected with ownCloud 10.3 and phpBB 3.3).

Bug Fixes:
- DietPi-Software | PHP: Resolved a critical issue where PHP install/update broke ARMv6 devices since Debian armhf does not support ARMv6 like Raspbian does. Many thanks for the fast user reports: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2794
- DietPi-Software | PHP: Resolved an issue where APT upgrade can fail due to insufficient sury.org APT repo preferences. Many thanks to @sifyer for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2795

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.23
(12/05/19)

Jessie support:
- The support for Debian Jessie is fading constantly by software titles and Debian itself, increasing the effort for us to work around the raising issues: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2332
- As a result we move Jessie systems to a dedicated "jessie-support" branch. Next DietPi v6.24 will still be merged into this branch as well, but for following updates it depends on how much additional related issues we face.
- We highly recommend to migrate to Stretch as fast as possible.
- Odroid C1: We have updated the image to Stretch based on Armbian 4.18 kernel. Existing Jessie installations will be moved to the jessie-support branch: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2561

Buster support:
- DietPi-Software | Resolved the last failing installs on Debian Buster systems by either fixing or disabling them: phpMyAdmin and Tomcat8 are currently not available on non-RPi Buster systems.
- DietPi on Debian Buster x86_64 systems can be considered as compatible and stable now. On ARM devices some last software install tests are outstanding, especially on Raspberry Pi with Raspbian particularities. We will ship experimental images for testing purpose soon.

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- DietPi-Banner | Added support for DietPi message of the day (MOTD). This is enabled by default, however, can be disabled. Checks for latest MOTD once a day.
- DietPi-Banner | Always prints the local IP during boot mode display: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2681
- DietPi-Benchmark | Increased default survey RootFS and RAM benchmark sizes. 100 MiB (from 10 MiB) for RootFS. RAM is 1/4 of available. This is ensure a more accurate calculation of throughput when we divide bytes against time, to obtain the MB/s result. Benchmarks now also run at Nice -19 and realtime I/O with priority 0 (highest).
- DietPi-Cleaner | Added a confirmation prompt, before removal of offline docs and man pages, as this may cause APT issues in some circumstances. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2751
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | When applying to Lighttpd, "webroot" authentication is now used instead of "standalone". This allows the auto-renewal service to succeed while Lighttpd is running. Many thanks to @minnux for testing this method: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2680#issuecomment-480095449
- DietPi-Arr_to_RAM | With v6.18 we silently added a new script (for Stretch and above) that allows linking Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr database files to RAM, increasing access performance, reducing disk I/O and avoiding constant external HDD spinning due to the very regular access to these files. This script has gone through some rework and polishing and can now be enabled to automatically link those databases to RAM on boot and store them back to disk on shutdown. Many thanks to @Dr0bac for providing valuable input and testing the development progress constantly: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2689
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | eCryptfs and vboxsf (VirtualBox shared folder) fstab entries are now preserved. Many thanks to @johnvick and @Phil1988 for suggesting: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2078, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2202
- DietPi-PREP | The script execution can now be fully automated via environment variables. Many thanks to @FredericGuilbault for adding this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2756
- DietPi-Config | Added support to toggle Intel CPU turbo/boost mode. Requires Intel CPU that supports the feature.
- DietPi-Config | G_CHECK_URL: Added ability to change the connection attempts and timeout, before DietPi URL checking assumes a dead link and failure: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2717
- DietPi-Config | Serial/UART device handling has been reworked. Serial login consoles can now be toggled for every found serial device individually. On RPi the primary UART can be completely disabled and warnings are prompted if Bluetooth and login console are to be enabled both on ttyAMA0. On update existing systems will be patched so that serial-getty masks and enabled instances are removed if the related serial device does not exist. This solves some error messages during boot.
- DietPi-Config | Network Adapter menu has been cleaned up. Proxy variables are now sourced from "/etc/bashrc.d/dietpi-proxy.sh" and proxy setup outside of DietPi scripts is detected.
- DietPi-NordVPN | Added ability to toggle auto start/connect during boot.
- DietPi-Software | Subsonic: Package has been updated to v6.1.5. Many thanks to @spectrumcomputing: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2702
- DietPi-Software | PHP: All systems will be upgraded to PHP7.3 for security, performance, compatibility and consistency across distro versions. Ondrejs (official Debian PHP maintainer) PHP repository (sury.org) is used for this on Jessie and Stretch, so general functionality and trustworthiness is assured. ownCloud and phpBB users will stay on PHP7.2 for where PHP7.3 is not yet supported. Your PHP configurations will be backed up and webserver configurations adjusted to match the new version. Nextcloud 13 and earlier, especially Jessie systems, will be upgraded to Nextcloud 14 to allow PHP7.3. A full Nextcloud backup will be done, your data, settings and custom apps will be preserved. We strongly advice to further upgrade to the current Nextcloud major version via its web UI updater.
- DietPi-Software | Subsonic: Runs now as limited user "subsonic". This change is as well applied to existing installs via patch during DietPi-Update: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2705
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard APT packages are now upgraded when running "apt-get upgrade". Many thanks to @swrobel for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2671
- DietPi-Software | LXQt, GIMP, XFCE4 Power manager: Now available for installations.
- DietPi-Software | Plex Media Server: All systems are migrated to the new official APT repository. This allows easy and consistent upgrades via APT. On ARM systems the until now used 3rd party dev2day repo receives no further updates and will be shut down soon, which makes the migration mandatory. Many thanks to @WolfganP for keeping us informed with news about Plex v1.15 and the new APT repo: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2655
- DietPi-Software | Logitech Media Server: Now installs the latest nightly version, since no public "releases" are done. As well the systemd service has gone through some update and now runs as limited user to align with other media servers, enhance security and follow the defaults of the DPKG package. The update/change is applied to existing installs via DietPi-Update as well. Your settings/date are preserved.
- DietPi-Software | Nextcloud Talk: We do not apply (D)TLS settings to coTURN any more. Since WebRTC is encrypted by itself there is no security benefit. More importantly Nextcloud Talk does not make use of the required TURNS protocol, so there is absolutely no point to apply these settings. The (D)TLS feature is meant to allow passing firewalls that only allow encrypted traffic. WebRTC, although encrypted, might not pass such firewalls since the encryption is not on transport layer. For those how are interested in further details and discussion: https://github.com/coturn/coturn/issues/33, https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/issues/257
- DietPi-Software | SABnzbd: Install latest version via GitHub master and skip adjusting existing config file. systemd unit and dependencies have been adjusted to match minimum requirements and official documentation. The update will be applied via DietPi v6.23 patch as well. Many thanks to @19eighties for reporting the outdated version: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2762
- DietPi-Software | Jackett: On non-ARMv6 devices the new (v0.11+) standalone (non-mono) binary is installed now. This is applied on DietPi-Update as well, preserving your settings: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2773
- DietPi-Software | Blynk: Enabled support for Debian Buster by using the new Java 11 binary.
- DietPi-Software | UrBackup: New version 2.3.8 is installed now. Many thanks to @DeathIsUnknown for informing us about the update: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2783

Bug Fixes:
- System | Debian has vastly reduced support for Jessie systems from their official APT repository. The limited possible list entries are applied during DietPi-Update. Many thanks to @BerndKohl for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2665
- DietPi-Set_swapfile | Resolved an issue where on first boot (and when calling the script manually) the swapfile creation is attempted on target file systems that do not support it (BTRFS). Many thanks to @mzramna for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/719#issuecomment-484205696
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where proxy settings would not be correct after a reboot. Many thanks to @stephantual for reporting this!: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2704
- DietPi-Update | Resolved an issue where on older images first run update didn't finalise as intended, leading to several first run setup issues, depending on the image age. The fix has been applied outside of the releases since only the online part of the updater is affected: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2684
- DietPi-Login | Resolved an issue where login as non-root user could result in a "sudo" password prompt or endless failure loop due to missing sudo permissions. Many thanks to @xsak for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2667
- DietPi-Software | Emby Server: Resolved an issue where download failed if the latest release does not contain a Debian package. Many thanks to @niblettr for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Transmission: Resolved an issue where double quotes in global software password caused a service startup failure. Many thanks to @Drew80 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2484#issuecomment-480675168

- DietPi-Software | Java: Resolved an issue where install fails on Jessie systems since the used jessie-backports APT repo does not exist any more: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2752
- DietPi-Software | Java: Resolved an issue where install fails on Buster systems since OpenJDK 8 packages are not available any more on Buster repo. OpenJDK 11 is installed instead, testing with Java software titles is outstanding.
- DietPi-Software | Node.js: Resolved an issue where install failed on ARMv6 since Node 12 does not support it any more. Many thanks to @axwax for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2755

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.22
(23/03/19)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- Security | The DietPi-Software global password is now stored with enhanced security which also resolves a warning on Buster systems: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2213
- System | /etc/bashrc.d/ now allows ".bash" file ending as well. We merged all contained DietPi scripts into one (/etc/bashrc.d/dietpi.bash): https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2636
- General | DietPi scripts now use the lightweight standalone "7zr" command to handle 7z archives. This allows us to lower the DietPi core package dependency from "p7zip-full" to "p7zip".
- RPi | DietPi does not set or change "framebuffer_depth" in config.txt any more which defaults to 16 which works in every known case. It will be re-added as fast as we find a case where another value is required.
- DietPi-Banner | You can now customise which options to display during system login. These include CPU temps, WAN IP, free disk space and more! Simply run 'dietpi-banner': https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2627
- DietPi-NordVPN | Added sent/received usage stats for VPN tunnel.
- DietPi-Sync | Sync will now abort if the source directory is empty. Merged dry run into real sync, as this was performed anyway to do required free space check. When "Sync" is selected, after dry run the user is presented a summary and given the option to view the detailed dry run log, cancel or continue with real sync. Some other minor fixes and enhancements have been applied as well. Many thanks to @midnightwatcher for doing this request.
- DietPi-Software | Emby Server: Now installs the latest version automatically (currently 4.0.2) which as well offers a native ARMv8 package: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2525
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard: Switched from 10.8.0.0 to 10.9.0.0 IP addresses on fresh installs to avoid doubled IP range use with OpenVPN. Many thanks to @XRay437 for pointing this out: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2491#issuecomment-461366739
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard: Changed the way users are advised to add multiple clients, to enhance concurrent connections. Many thanks to @curiosity-seeker for reporting and testing this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2491#issuecomment-462419860
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard: Hardened Debian Sid repo handling on RPi to prevent accidental non-WireGuard package installs. Many thanks to @rucknapucknavitz @1985kasper and @g7kse for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2568#issuecomment-465725312
- DietPi-Software | GMediaRender: Enabled support for Debian/Raspbian Buster by using the up-to-date APT repo package.

- DietPi-Software | UrBackup: Now installs updated version 2.3.7. Many thanks to @DeathIsUnknown for the information: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2577
- DietPi-Software | Deluge: Reworked the installer to better match the Debian package defaults and recommendations/examples from official docs. Deluge now runs as user "debian-deluged", logs have been moved to "/var/log/deluged/" and the init.d service with its traces are removed, which are all pre-generated by the Debian APT package. The systemd units have been adjusted according to the official Deluge documentation. These changes are applied as well to existing installs during DietPi update, the old user "deluge" and obsolete configurations are removed. Your active configurations and data are preserved, the installer has been as well enhanced to better handle existing installs and never touch existing configs. Note that access to the Deluge console has to be done as user "debian-deluged" (sudo -u debian-deluged deluge-console). A related access issue to the console has been fixed by this as well. Many thanks to @seanmikhaels for reporting this issue.
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Updated to latest version (2.25), thanks @midwan: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2599
- DietPi-Software | Netdata: On Debian Stretch/Buster and Raspbian Buster an up-to-date APT package is available, which will now be installed instead of our custom build. Many thanks to @74cmonty for this information: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2446
- DietPi-Software | DietPi-RAMlog: When installing/enabling RAMlog, the /var/log mount point will be now cleaned before mounting the tmpfs on it, while preserving the existing logs metadata. This resolves a warning on early boot stage and frees the disk space consumed by the disk log before.
- DietPi-Software | rTorrent: Runs now as user "rtorrent" and creates files as group "dietpi" with 775/664 permissions. Enabled Buster support and enhanced config file handling on reinstall: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2633

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.20
(28/01/19)

Image line-up:
- We removed Jessie images from our download server (besides for Odroid C1), since we see no advantage to use them anymore. Existing Jessie systems are still supported, but we encourage all users to consider switching to a fresh Stretch image by times: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2332

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- DietPi-PREP | Removed the option to install a Jessie system. Removed the option to install DietPi on top of a Wheezy image, since an upgrade over two distro version would be required, which is not reliable. It is still possible to install DietPi on top of a Jessie image, where a distro upgrade to Stretch would be applied: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2332
- General | RPi-Update: In our effort to improve system stability, and, offer software installations which build custom modules (e.g. WireGuard), we can not longer support systems with non-stock APT kernel installed. If "rpi-update" is installed during update, DietPi will prompt and return you back to stock APT kernel.
- General | Moved the remaining conf/* files located on DietPi-RAMdisk to /var/lib/dietpi or into DietPi-PREP, and removed /DietPi/dietpi/conf completely. These files were only used once or never, thus have no business inside the RAMdisk.
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Improved available options for HDMI boost setting: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2350
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Headless display mode is now applied via undocumented config.txt setting. Removed/Replaced some other obsolete config.txt entries: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2402
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Added info to "hifiberry-dacplus" sound device overlay that it supports the AMP2 DAC. Thanks to @Lat Dior for reporting the issue and testing the solution.
- DietPi-Config | WiFi Hotspot: You can now toggle support for 802.11 N. Please note this is device and compatibility dependent, mileage may vary.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Now allows to check & repair the boot file system and trigger it for root file system on next reboot: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1740#issuecomment-388325204
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Updated to v2.24, thanks @midwan! Brings several bug fixes, new features and improvements over the previous version (2.19). Please check the version history for full details on the changes made: https://github.com/midwan/amiberry/wiki/Version-history
- DietPi-Software | DietPi-NordVPN: Now available for installation. Includes a GUI which allows for easy connection to a list of NordVPN servers 'dietpi-nordvpn'. If you need a NordVPN subscription, please use this link: https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=5305&url_id=902
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard VPN is now available for installation. Is can be easily configured as client or as server, passing either all client traffic through the tunnel, local network access only, or server access only, e.g. as well in combination with Pi-hole, to have remote ad blocking.
- DietPi-Software | SickRage has been replaced by Medusa, which is now available for install: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2239

- DietPi-Software | Nextcloud Talk: Disabled the very verbose coturn logging by default to reduce disk I/O. This can be overridden via /etc/turnserver.conf: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2321
- DietPi-Software | Deluge: UMask 002 applied to all downloads: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2339
- DietPi-Software | Netdata: Updated to v1.11.1 and now runs as user "netdata": https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2337
- DietPi-Software | ownCloud/Nextcloud: Updated webserver configs to match current recommendations and security hardenings. Only applied on new installs. To apply manually, run "dietpi-software reinstall 47" (ownCloud) or "dietpi-software reinstall 114" (Nextcloud). You will be informed about the new configs, which then need to be manually moved to overwrite the old ones, since we don't want to mess with manual changes: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2361
- DietPi-Software | OpenSSH: Host keys won't be recreated anymore on reinstall, only on first boot of a fresh image, using now "dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server" to generate default key types based on distro.
- DietPi-Software | Dropbear: Now installs only the "dropbear-run" package on Stretch (and above), which matches the default DietPi setup on our images and PREP script.

- DietPi-Software | Grafana: Now the new official APT repo is used for all architectures (excluding ARMv6), which allows updates to the current upstream version (currently v5.4.3) as well. This change will be applied to existing installs on dietpi-update to v6.20. Thanks to @jvteleco for informing us: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2449
- DietPi-Update | Added optional ability to automatically update DietPi, when updates are available. Please note, this is disabled by default.
- DietPi-Sync | Removed the compression option, which has no effect on local sync, since files are not stored compressed, but only transferred compressed through remote sync protocols, which are currently not offered by DietPi-Sync.
- DietPi-RAMlog/Logclear | The internally rotated LetsEncrypt (Certbot) log files are now removed, hourly with DietPi-RAMlog enabled, or when executing DietPi-Logclear manually.

Bug Fixes:
- DietPi-Software | LXDE: Installation will no longer enable the weather application. This is due to Yahoo API hard coded into LXpanel, being taken offline: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2416#issuecomment-456805925

v6.15
(12/09/18)

Many thanks to PINE64, for becoming our 1st Patreon Legend and supporting our project! As one of their rewards, you will see PINE64 displayed on login via the DietPi-Banner.

Known issues / In progress:
- DietPi-Software | Open Bazaar: Installation updated to server version 2, which now runs via Go language. At the current state, client OB connections are failing, still under investigation: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1090#issuecomment-419613346

Changes / Improvements / Optimizations:
- General | Changed survey and bug report uploads to use ssh.dietpi.com (previously IP): https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2022#issuecomment-415470064
- General | 1st run setup and dietpi-update logs are now created in RAM, then copied to disk once completed '/var/tmp/dietpi/logs/dietpi-firstrun-setup.log'. This will speed up 1st run setup installation for slow SBCs and/or rootFS.
- General | PineA64: Image updated to v6.14, also contains the latest kernel/uboot by Ayufan (0.6.2): https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2026
- General | Resolved an issue where the initial 1st run connection test would fail, if timesync had not yet completed, and, the SSL cert of the connection test site is not valid for current date on system: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2039

NB: 'cpu' command will always list the min/max frequencies read from kernel values, Intel CPUs do not update these values, however, you can gauge CPU frequency range by running 'cpu' to monitor the current CPU freq (use of stress test in 'dietpi-config' may also help).
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Added support to set a global idle duration, before drives are powered down. This feature uses hdparm. Not all drives will support this feature, however, its the best we can do, considering the lack of any standardised system across all drives, compatible with hdparm and visa versa: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2001
