Many thanks to PINE64, for becoming our 1st Patreon Legend and supporting our project! As one of their rewards, you will see PINE64 displayed on login via the DietPi-Banner.

Changes / Improvements / Optimizations:
General | Changed Survey and Bugreport uploads to use ssh.dietpi.com (previously IP): https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/2022#issuecomment-415470064
General | 1st run setup and dietpi-update logs are now created in RAM, then copied to disk once completed '/var/tmp/dietpi/logs/dietpi-firstrun-setup.log'. This will speed up 1st run setup installation for slow SBCs and/or rootFS.
General | PineA64: Image updated to v6.14, also contains the latest kernel/uboot by Ayufan (0.6.2): https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/2026
General | Resolved an isssue where the initial 1st run connection test would fail, if timesync had not yet completed, and, the SSL cert of the connection test site is not valid for current date on system: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/2039
General| SparkySBC: Support for native DSD playback on iFi Pro iDSD. Many thanks @sudeep: https://github.com/sparky-sbc/sparky-test/tree/master/dsd-marantz
DietPi-Backup/Sync | rsync transfer: Now shows progress information during the transfer: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/2044#issuecomment-417779406
DietPi-Backup | Added an option to delete the currently selected backup, if it exists.

DietPi-Config | Added support for setting CPU min/max frequencies on Intel based CPUs. NB: 'cpu' command will always list the min/max frequencies read from kernel values, Intel CPUs do not update these values, however, you can gauge CPU frequency range by running 'cpu' to monitor the current CPU freq (use of stress test in 'dietpi-config' may also help).
DietPi-Drive_Manager | Added support to set a global idle duration, before drives are powered down. This feature uses hdparm. Not all drives will support this feature, however, its the best we can do, considering the lack of any standardised system across all drives, compatible with hdparm and visa versa: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/2001

DietPi-Software | A new unified download&install function is implemented, which allows more consistent download and install of software, using /tmp RAMFS as working directory and parallel dependencies installation via G_THREAD.
DietPi-Software | Koel: Installation will now skip webserver, as Koel uses PHP-CLI instead. To not mess with webserver served pages, Koel install directory is moved to "/mnt/dietpi_userdata/koel", for existing installs as well.
DietPi-Software | Mono: Now installs 'mono-complete' by default, required for Mono based applications (eg: Radarr/Sonarr/Lidarr/Jackett etc)
DietPi-Software | Lidarr: Now available for installation, automatically download music: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1874
DietPi-Software | Samba Server: Now creates and defaults to the login creds for the 'dietpi' user (previously 'root'). For fresh installations of Samba only: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1991#issuecomment-410505982
DietPi-Software | Folding@Home: Now available for installation on x86_64 machines. Folding@home is a distributed computing project for disease research that simulates protein folding, computational drug design, and other types of molecular dynamics. As of today, the project is using the idle resources of personal computers owned by volunteers from all over the world. Thousands of people contribute to the success of this project. Thanks to @nnovaes for bringing this to our attention!
DietPi-Software | XFCE: Added support for shutdown, restart, hibernate and suspend directly from XFCE panel by default. Existing installs will not be touched, but if required simply run: "apt-get -y install upower policykit-1"
DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Installation code updated to support the latest release (v4). If you want to upgrade your existing installation, we highly recommend existing users who have this installed to: Uninstall Pi-hole via "dietpi-software", once completed, install Pi-hole again via "dietpi-software": https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1696
DietPi-Drive_Manager | Added NFSv3 mount support. Drive manager now detects NFSv3-only server and offers to enter the required server-side path to the shared folder: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1940
DietPi-Drive_Manager | Now installs "ntfs-3g" and "hfsplus" on demand, if those file systems are detected. This allows us to ship images without "ntfs-3g" and "hfsplus" preinstalled, which are not required by most users. Those packages will be removed on v6.13 patch as well, if the related file systems are not detected.
DietPi-LetsEncrypt | Added information/warning about HTTPS and HSTS according to web applications with standalone webserver: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1908
DietPi-Cron | /etc/cron.minutely/ is now disabled by default, to reduce cron executions and logs. This is also patched with v6.13, if no script is placed within the folder. Use "dietpi-cron" to enable and configure this feature.
General | All DietPi scripts by default now use /tmp RAMFS to create, download and handle temporary files. By this we speed up especially installations and reduce disk I/O: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1801
General | By default systemd-logind is now masked on DietPi images. This can be changed by setting AUTO_UNMASK_LOGIND=1 within dietpi.txt. As well it will be unmasked automatically, if libpam-systemd was installed during dietpi-software installation: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1767
General | "fake-hwclock" is purged now on first run setup and v6.13 patch, if a real hardware clock is available.
Image | NanoPC-T4: Image updated which now includes custom kernel/modules created by @carlosedp. Adds CIFS, docker support and much more. Please note, WiFi scan is intermittent with this kernel, and, may take a few attempts to be successful, however, we believe the additional modules are a higher priority: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1829
Image | RPi: New RPi images will be shipped without "initramfs-tools" preinstalled. The RPi bootloader does no require it and there are alternatives, e.g. "rpi-initramfs-tools" and "tiny-initramfs". The package can be manually purged on RPi systems, but "kmod" and "udev" need to be marked als manually installed first, so they will never be removed: "apt-mark manual kmod udev && apt-mark auto initramfs-tools && G_AGA"

Bug Fixes:
DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where mounting drives with the non-default path, would not re-select the same drive on the next screen.

v102
(03/12/15)

Important DietPi Changes:
All DietPi images have been updated to v102 and are required to run the latest version of DietPi. Previous images will no longer update, and are no longer supported.
Passwords | All passwords throughout DietPi are now dietpi (previously raspberry). This includes everything with a password (eg: dietpi-software installations).
DietPi for Odroid C1/XU4 has changed to Debian Jessie | The DietPi images are now based on the excellent Debian Jessie images by Meveric http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=96&t=17542&p=114970#p114970. Why Debian? First, its more streamline and lightweight when compared to Ubuntu. Second, it reduces my coding workload from 3 distros to 2, as Ubuntu has different packages/file paths/requirements that required additional coding and testing.

New Features:
DietPi-Launcher | Menu system that allows you to run any of the DietPi programs, all from one place.
DietPi-Cron | Menu system that allows you to change the cron start times: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/118#issuecomment-161051801

Software Additions:
DietPi-Software (Odroid's C1/XU4) | Kodi is now available for Odroid C1 and XU4.
DietPi-Software (Odroid's C1/XU4) | DietPi optimized LXDE desktop is now available. Vastly improved C1 (no longer uses FBturbo driver).
DietPi-Software (Odroid's C1/XU4, OPi) | DietPi optimized Weaved installation is now available.
DietPi-Software (Odroids C1/XU4) | DietPi optimized MiniDLNA installation option is now available.

Changes / Improvements / Optimizations:
General | Support for Raspberry PiZero (honestly?, i didn't have to change a thing :) )
General | Removed one of the reboots during first run filesystem expansion. This will speed up the initial setup of your system. Available for all DietPi images v101 or higher.
DietPi-Software | PHP now sets upload_max_filesize and php_max_post_size to 2GB. This will increase the max filesize limit with php uploads (eg: Owncloud). Previously 20~MB.
DietPi-Software | PHP now sets upload_tmp_dir to /var/tmp/php_upload_tmp. This was previously stored on /tmp as ramdisk, which limited php uploads (eg: Owncloud) to half your total RAM, causing possible failed uploads.
DietPi-Software (Jessie) | PHP will also install and optimize APCu along side Opcache (APCu is data store, OPcache is opcode cache). This should vastly improve webserver performance.
DietPi-Software | HAproxy will now install v1.6.2.
DietPi-Software | Deluge-web no longer requires a service restart by the user during 1st run.
DietPi-Software | Enabled Deluged logging with level warning to /var/log/deluged.log and /var/log/deluge-web.log
DietPi-Config > Advanced > Time sync (ntpd) | New options. Allows you to change the update frequency of NTPD time syncs. eg: Daily/Hourly/disabled etc.
DietPi-Config > Performance > Overclocking | Tweaked the RPi 1/2 overclocking settings to improve stability. These are settings I personally use across all my RPi devices during testing, and, should be stable for all.
DietPi-Config > Advanced > Swapfile size | When the user changes the swapfile size, the new swapfile and its size will now be generated at the same time. Previously this was completed during boot.
DietPi-Config > Advanced > Swapfile size | Can now also be disabled.
DietPi-Config (OPi) | You can now update the Kernel and Firmware for your OrangePi. This will run Loboris kernel update script: https://github.com/loboris/OrangePi-BuildLinux/blob/master/update_kernel.sh
General | /etc/apt/sources.list is now unified across all DietPi Jessie images (excluding Raspbian), using the global Debian mirror: http://ftp.debian.org/debian
General | All firmware and kernel have been updated to latest.

Bug fixes:
DietPi-Update | Some users were experiencing wget failures due to SSL/cert issue on GitHub, or local network setup. This was causing the 1st run update and installation to fail. The script has been updated to use curl which does not fail. https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/125
Kernel Modules (OPi) | Resolved issues with invisible modules by updating the kernel / firmware to latest (provided by Loboris). https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/115
General (Jessie) | Resolved an issue where SystemD would throw warnings on /dev/tty1 regarding duplicate fstab entries. USB mounts are now disabled by default in fstab on new images. DietPi will enable one of the mounts as required during "1st run USB drive" setup.
DietPi-Software (Odroid C1) | Resolved an issue with Kodi launching as black screen.
DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue with DietPi-Cam not starting during boot. Many thanks to Rich T for his assistance with debugging: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=218#p842

DietPi-Config > AutoBoot options | Added "Console: Automatic Login" option. Useful for custom projects that require autologin on main terminal (tty1), without launching a specific program.
DietPi-Config (RPi) > Audio options > Soundcard | You can now select "none" as your soundcard. This will disable the snd-bcm2835 kernel module, saving memory and resources.
DietPi-Config (OPi PC) | Changed 3.5mm asound.conf to use plug rather than direct hw.
DietPi-Software  (OPi PC) | Installing HiFi will now default to 3.5mm output and unmute it, regardless of default device used in asound.conf.

Bug fixes:
DietPi-Ramlog | Resolved an issue where "Full" and "None" logging modes, would clear logfile contents during boot. https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/112
DietPi-Apt-get_Update | Resolved an issue where the state file would stay at 0 (which believes apt-get is running), causing endless waiting.
DietPi-Software (RPi Jessie) | Resolved an issue where Kodi would install using packages from deb.multimedia, rather than Raspbian. This was due to FFMPEG installation which requires the additional repo. After installing FFMPEG, the deb.multimedia repo will now be removed. https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/111
DietPi-Software  (OPi PC) | Resolved broken volume controls for HiFi (mpd+ympd) using 3.5mm output.
DietPi-External_drive_setup (RPi) | When setting up a dedicated external drive, rootdelay=10 will be added to cmdline.txt. This should prevent slow powering external drives, from failing to be ready and mountable during boot.
