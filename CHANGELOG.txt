v6.27
(XX/12/19)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- FriendlyARM ZeroPi | Initial hardware identifier (ID: 59) and support for this device has been added to DietPi. Many thanks to @Stephan for creating the related DietPi image: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3221
- RPi4 | Added generic RPi4 revision code detection to include the new revisions [abc]03112 and potential new PCB v1.3 til v1.9 once released. Many thanks to @Joulinar for reporting the missing new revision code: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3257#issuecomment-565370856
- RPi4 | Since RPi4, bootloader and USB firmware is stored on an internal EEPROM, which is not updated/flashed by the firmware APT package installs automatically. The additional "rpi-eeprom" package comes with an EEPROM update script and boot service, which will now be installed on DietPi update and firstrun setup automatically, if RPi4 is detected. Those firmware updates include power consumption (hence heat emission) optimisations and enable additional boot methods, currently network boot and USB boot is planned as well. This was reason enough for us to implement it automatically for all RPi4 systems. Additionally you can actively install/update the EEPROM manually via dietpi-config > Advanced Options > Update RPi4 EEPROM firmware. For additional information, read the official docs: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/booteeprom.md Many thanks to @trueaspects for informing us about this important subject: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3217
- Virtual Machines | Intel/AMD CPU microcode update packages are not installed/purged from virtual machines. The CPU is provided by the host, hypervisors do not allow to update microcode from within the guest, reasonably, and if they did, this would be serious security and stability issue.
- DietPi-PREP | New images will have all man pages and documentation files for installed packages available. Those were removed until now, but prevented users from simply installing man-db to view man pages on the system, without reinstalling packages to restore those first. Many thanks to @smudgered for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3259
- DietPi-Software | The general network check against first sources.list entry has been replaced by a pure connectivity test and separate DNS resolver test via ping. This solves an issue where sources.list parsing failed when [arch=...] was specified and allows better debugging. The sources list entries themselves are checked and error-handled by G_AGUP already. Ping target IP for connection test and domain for DNS resolver test can be set via dietpi.txt, default is Cloudflare DNS IP and domain which should be very reliable and fast all over the world. Many thanks to @lwqcz for reporting the issue and providing a solution: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3243
- DietPi-Software | TasmoAdmin: The administrative website to manage ESP8266 devices flashed with Tasmota for smart home systems is now available for install. Many thanks to @svh1985 for implementing this software title: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3103
- DietPi-Software | ownCloud: Enabled install on Buster, Bullseye and ARMv6 RPi models (RPi1+Zero). ownCloud 10.3 has been release with PHP7.3 support, hence it can be used with native distro PHP7.3 and does not require Ondrej's PHP repo which does not support armv6hf.
- DietPi-Software | Syncthing: Enhanced service by security hardenings and to allow internal updates and auto updates without failing to restart. Moved binary from /etc/syncthing to /opt/syncthing to match FHS and disabled file logging, which is an unnecessary overhead, since logs can be easily viewed via "journalctl -u syncthing". Changes will be applied to all installs on v6.27 update, existing configs won't be touched by this.
- DietPi-Software | NAA daemon: Latest version is now scraped from base URL and installed automatically. Many thanks to @Heroldgray for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3191
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Python3.8 will be installed for the pyenv from now on due to Python3.6 deprecation. Many thanks to @sdomotica for providing this information: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3219
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: When selecting for install, one will be informed about possibly long install/build times. Many thanks to @Gill-Bates for doing this suggestion to avoid users assuming their install process being stuck: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2897
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Vastly reduced Home Assistant dependencies and install complexity. It does not run inside a virtualenv of pyenv anymore, since it has already its unique pyenv Python instance. pyenv is still required due to the large amount of specific module versions, required for HA and its integrations. The alternative would be a venv from a globally installed Python instance, but this requires further thoughts and discussion. The amount of development libraries and tools, installed via APT, has been updated and reduced to a minimum to build Python and Home Assistant inside the pyenv without errors and warnings. There is a slightly increased chance that certain HA components need additional development packages. To cover this, two new settings have been added to dietpi.txt: "SOFTWARE_HOMEASSISTANT_APT_DEPS" and "SOFTWARE_HOMEASSISTANT_PIP_DEPS". Add a space-separated list of APT packages and pip modules respectively, to have those installed automatically with Home Assistant. As well activating the pyenv environment from console is now easier possible via "source /home/homeassistant/pyenv-activate.sh" as user "homeassistant". Additionally "/home/homeassistant/homeassistant-update.sh" has been added, which can be called by any sudo-capable user to update Home Assistant easily.
- DietPi-Software | Node-RED: Access permissions to I2C is now enabled by default on RPi and other SBCs which ship a configured "i2c" group by default. Many thanks to @NastySpill for reporting an underlying issue: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=6862
- DietPi-Software | Gitea: The latest version will now be pulled from GitHub automatically.
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Updated to v3.0.9, a large update from v2.25 with many improvements, see: https://github.com/midwan/amiberry/releases
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Since we ship a tailored SDL2 version, this has now been merged right into the Amiberry download archive and install directory, to not interfere with other system-wide installed SDL2 instances.
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: Add GPU-accelerated support for Odroid N2 via fbdev driver and special Kodi build, provided by Meveric. Many thanks to @ernero93 for doing this request: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3255

Bug Fixes:
- DietPi-PREP | Resolved an issue, where in rare cases a wrong $PATH variable could break command calls. Many thanks to @dtm2001 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3206
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where, after transferring the root file system, the script itself could revert the fstab entry, since a reboot was not forced anymore since v6.22. This change has been reverted, hence a reboot cannot be skipped to avoid any fstab revert and inconsistency with cmdline. Many thanks to @DutchFlash for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=6645
- DietPi-Autostart | Resolved an issue where non-interactive script calls, e.g. done by dietpi-software installs, reset prior made auto login user choices. Many thanks to @zedrdave for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3242
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Resolved an issue where PSU noise reduction state always shows "[Off]". HDMI output will now be toggled immediately, hence no reboot is required for changes to take effect. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3187
- DietPi-Software | ownCloud/Nextcloud: An important security fix has been applied to our ownCloud/Nextcloud Nginx configs. This has been merged into our other GitHub branches as well, hence all fresh installs wont be affected. Read more about it: https://nextcloud.com/blog/urgent-security-issue-in-nginx-php-fpm/

Many thanks to @slopsjon, @tyjtyj and @pakikje for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=6531, https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=20408#p20408
- DietPi-Software | Google AIY: Resolved an issue where fresh install failed to start due to missing permissions
- DietPi-Software | Grafana: Resolved an issue where install failed on RPi 1/Zero Buster systems. The fix includes an update of Grafana to the latest official version for those models. Many thanks to @TBail for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3213
- DietPi-Software | Jackett: Resolved an issue where the internal updater broke the Jackett instance. Automated updates can be safely enabled again. Many thanks to @ngosang for providing the workaround: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2593
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Resolved an issue where choosing to block public admin panel access on Nginx failed. Many thanks to @anubis-genix for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3024#issuecomment-550342684
- DietPi-Software | Java: Resolved an issue where install on ARMv6 RPis (1/Zero) on Buster system failed, since Java 11 is not ARMv6-compatible. On these system, Java 8 is now installed instead. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3182
- DietPi-Software | ruTorrent: Resolved an issue where rTorrent and the webserver didn't have sufficient permissions to read and write ruTorrent web UI settings and data. Many thanks to @notDavid for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3244

v6.26
(15/10/19)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- General | Support for Debian Jessie has now been fully dropped from DietPi code. Jessie systems are moved to the "jessie-support" Git branch and will stay on v6.25. Critical bugs, if reported, may still be fixed, but DietPi-Software related issues and new features will not be handled anymore by the DietPi code team. However, everyone is free to open pull requests against the jessie-support branch: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/tree/jessie-support
- General | Initial support and definitions for Debian Bullseye, the new Debian testing version, have been added to DietPi code. You can now create Bullseye systems via DietPi-PREP: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3009
- General | DietPi scripts, i.e. dietpi-software, will not overwrite you custom permissions in /mnt/dietpi_userdata anymore. Instead required permissions are now only applied for individual software titles that are being installed. Besides saving you time to re-apply custom permission, this as well enhances security in some cases where software installers/archives apply/contain stricter per-file/dir permissions. Many thanks to @JJGO and @johnvick for suggesting this enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2641
- General | On first boot, when DietPi-Software finishes the initial setup, it is now assured that all APT packages, including firmware, are upgraded by performing an "apt-get dist-upgrade"/"apt full-upgrade". Since it includes upgrades regardless of underlying dependency and conflict changes, which in rare cases can perform unwanted removals, we do not do this on regualar DietPi-Update/Software runs. But on first boot, without additional packages installed yet, it is safe. Many thanks to @cmessin1 for doing this request: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3098
- Rockchip | Experimental GPU acceleration support for RK3399 SoCs and ASUS Tinker Board has been re-enabled.
- RPi | The haveged daemon has been replaced with rng-tools, an alternative which does not work on all devices, but has been proven to work on RPi, is default on Raspbian and uses less RAM on idle.
- RPi4 | The default CPU temperature limit (temp_limit) has been raised from 65°C to 75°C, since this device runs significantly hotter then previous RPi model. Many thanks to @trueaspects and @Trunkzeh for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3019, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3151
- DietPi-Globals | The environment variable $G_USER_INPUTS has been renamed to $G_INTERACTIVE, which describes better what it does. When setting this to "0", DietPi scripts will run non-interactively, i.e. all whiptail dialog prompts and other tasks that require manual user input are skipped. Note that this is not required when running scripts from cron jobs or systemd units, since those have no STDIN attached which makes DietPi scripts run non-interactively automatically. Scripts will stay backwards-compatible, thus respect $G_USER_INPUTS for a while, but please adjust your scripts or docs where you make use of it. Many thanks to @AtkLordOverAll for contributing this change: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3041
- DietPi-PostBoot | /var/log/boottime is not created anymore. Please use "systemd-analyze" to get much more accurate and detailed boot information.
- DietPi-PostBoot | The pre-login banner has been slightly adjusted: Default login credentials are now only shown on first boot, since the information is obsolete when user changed the password. As well an info has been added that one needs to hit <return> to show the username input field.
- DietPi-Banner/NordVPN: DietPi-NordVPN has a new input command to print the current VPN connection state: "dietpi-nordvpn status". This has been implemented as well into DietPi-Banner to optionally show NordVPN connection state on login automatically. Many thanks to @svh1985 for implementing this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3084
- DietPi-NordVPN | Added options for connection up/down scripts, e.g. to implement killswitches, answer inbound connections from outside local network correctly, safe and track connection uptime, and similar tasks. Many thanks to @svh1985 for implementing this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3047
- DietPi-Config | Audio Options: Menu has been reworked. Audio capabilities (ALSA) can be enabled and disabled as a separate option. If enabled, generic sound card auto-detection has been added to the bottom of the list for all devices. This allows the selection of generic sound devices on all SBCs, e.g. if unknown to DietPi or if our hard-coded card/device IDs are wrong due to additional attached audio hardware.
- DietPi-Config | Some /etc/modprobe.d/ configs are merged to less files and mostly prefixed with "dietpi-", to allow easier differentiation between Debian/pre-image and DietPi files.
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Update certain config.txt settings to match new firmware version. WiFi and Bluetooth is now disabled via related dtoverlays, which should further reduce hardware and firmware loads.
- DietPi-Config | Added overclocking profiles for RPi4. Many thanks to @aftensleuk for request and valuable suggestions: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=6225
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Re-added previously removed options to adjust initial turbo for CPU frequency on boot and to lower the idle CPU frequency. The related firmware issues have been fixed with a recent update: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3147
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Removed the option to adjust CPU frequency limits. On RPi the dynamic CPU governors only jump between "arm_freq" and "arm_freq_min", hence those limits should be set via overclocking profile and the newly re-added "ARM Idle Frequency" option.
- DietPi-Config | RPi1/Zero: OpenGL modes/drivers can now be successfully selected/installed from display resolution menu.
- DietPi-Software | TightVNC: Since Stretch, TightVNC has been replaced by TigerVNC, thus the install option has now been removed from code.
- DietPi-Software | SDL2: Since we ship a tailored build for Amiberry, the general install option for SDL2 has been removed, instead it will be installed/updated along with Amiberry. If you require SDL2 for any other purpose, please install the "libsdl2-2.0.0" package from APT repository: https://packages.debian.org/libsdl2
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Logging to /var/log/pihole.log is now disabled by default, since it is not required in usual cases. Query logs, shown in web UI, are stored in database. This might also resolve possible pihole-FTL crashes in combination with DietPi-RAMlog and DietPi-Logclear. Many thanks to @kuerious for reporting and @Mcat12 for providing helpful information on this topic: https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL/issues/614
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Webserver configs have been added to block public access to the blocking page, optionally as well to the admin panel and generally block access to dot files/dirs (.git*) inside the admin panel directory. Parts are inspired by the official Lighttpd config, provided by Pi-hole: https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/advanced/lighttpd.conf.debian
                             Many thanks to @AtkLordOverAll for his effort to implement this for Lighttpd initially + the choice during install to block public admin panel access as well: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3054
- DietPi-Software | OpenVPN: Rsyslog is not installed anymore together with OpenVPN server. Logs are available via "journalctl -u openvpn", all system logs via "journalctl". If you require persistent logs, uninstall DietPi-RAMlog via dietpi-software and make the journal boot persistent via: mkdir /var/log/journal
- DietPi-Software | Gogs: On ARMv7 and x86_64 now the latest version from GitHub is installed. Reinstalls will upgrade the version while preserving existing settings. Many thanks to @LazyLama for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2999
- DietPi-Software | Webmin: Install is now done via official APT repository to allow easier updates. To apply this to all systems, it is reinstalled on DietPi-Update to v6.26. Additionally the dependency on rsyslog has been removed. The Webmin logging panel still depends on rsyslog, but the overhead shall not be applied to all systems by default. Instead users can now decide themselves, whether they need to see system logs on Webmin, or not, and in case apply custom logging settings as well.
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Enabled support for RPi4 and Odroid XU4. Thanks to @midwan for providing the binaries: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3104
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: Updated install steps to avoid deprecations of the current upstream version. As well the service will not run as primary group "dietpi" anymore, which is only required for software that creates media files. Many thanks to @jcorporation (developer of myMPD) for providing this information as well as a smooth build script that updates old instances gracefully: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3097
- DietPi-Software | WiFi Hotspot: Since on some systems, a hostapd service mask was found, it is now unmasked on install. As well our custom compiled binaries are now only installed on RTL8188C* devices where no special Realtek hostapd package is available. Many thanks to @symbios24 for reporting the service mask issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2962
- DietPi-Software | Fail2Ban is not handled by DietPi-Services anymore, since the brute-force protection shall stay active during updates, installs, backups etc. The service is now started by systemd on boot and stays active until shutdown. Additionally on fresh installs the default jail.conf is optimised for the set "route" ban action: "blackhole" is now the route type, which does not send any respond to blocked requests.
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard: Support for RPi1 + RPi Zero (ARMv6 models) has been enabled by switching to Bullseye as source repo, which is available for Raspbian as well. Additionally on RPi, the WireGuard kernel module is now rebuilt automatically after kernel package upgrades. Many thanks to @johnnyt83 for suggestion RPi1/Zero support and his efforts to test the source build: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2997
- DietPi-Software | Gitea: Version 1.9.4 will be shipped from now on. Many thanks to @msongz and @minhphuc429 for implementing this update: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3138, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3154
- DietPi-Software | Aria2: Runs now as it's own user "aria2" and group "dietpi" with home dir and config file moved to /mnt/dietpi_userdata/aria2/. Besides satisfying security standards, this allows other download and media related software, provided by dietpi-software, direct access to Aria2 downloads without the need for custom permission changes. Additionally the current session (download states) are saved on service stop and every 60 seconds, to prevent current tasks from being lost on reboot or power loss. Aria2 will be reinstalled with v6.26 to apply these changes. Many thanks to @msongz for implementing and testing the session feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3139

Bug Fixes:
- General | Removed an obsolete OpenMediaVault cron job and binary that was leftover on at least one of our images (NanoPi NEO2) and is not part of the current OMV packages, thus save to remove in every case. Many thanks to @kt1024 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2994
- General | Resolved an issue where install of required APT packages for certain scripts could fail in the rare case that APT lists are outdated and old packages are not available in the repo anymore. Many thanks to @Paulisper for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2996
- General | Resolved an issue on some Buster systems where console-setup fails on boot to apply keyboard layout and console settings. Many thanks to @jaxjexjox for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2912#issuecomment-532100542
- Rock64/RockPro64 | Resolved an issue where DietPi could not obtain the active network adapter and IP, if onboard Ethernet was used. This is because of a kernel-related bug, which seems to cause Ethernet connection instabilities as well in cases. A workaround is applied to all new Rock(Pro)64 images and via DietPi-Update. Many thanks to @svh1985 for reporting this issue, as well as searching and testing the workaround: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3066
- DietPi-Update | Resolved an issue where the script did not exit on error: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3127
- DietPi-Login | Resolved an issue during first run setup, where DietPi-Software was called with mostly wrong whiptail menu dimensions. This lead to info prompts and menus being quite small, in particular the "Install" menu entry, that one needs to select, being only visible when navigating to the bottom. Many thanks to @pbecks1963 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3053
- DietPi-NordVPN | Resolved an issue where the server menu could have wrong entries or even fail, if foreign files were placed inside the config directory. Many thanks to @svh1985 for reporting this issue and implementing a fix: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3047
- DietPi-Run_NTPD | Resolved an issue where changing time sync mode or mirror, from within time sync error prompt, led to a concurrent script execution. Many thanks to @Sopor for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3010
- DietPi-Services | Resolved an issue where single service calls failed if their names contain certain special characters, like dots. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3059
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on RPi where I2C baudrate was not applied correctly, thus selection was ineffective. Many thanks to @flashspys for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2966
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on RPi where headless mode did not disable all video outputs and framebuffer as intended, since the used config.txt setting has been removed with recent firmware versions.
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on RPi4 where SDTV/composite video output did not happen when selecting the related resolution menu entries.
- DietPi-Config | On RPi4, vc4-kms-v3d option has been removed from display resolution menu, since the full KMS driver is not supported on RPi4 currently.
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where the script tells you that SQLite will be installed as pre-req, while actually a desktop is required and LXDE will be installed.
- DietPi-Software | X11/Kodi on Odroid C2: Resolved an issue on Odroid C2 where Kodi failed to start. GPU drivers and X11 config will be updated during DietPi-Update to cover this issue. Many thanks to @alexeylutskov for reporting this issue and testing the fix: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3028
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: Resolved an issue where Kodi failed on RPi Buster and RPi4. Many thanks to @GulyFMG, @derdershat and @jonyskids for reporting this issue, searching and testing workarounds: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3031
- DietPi-Software | Gitea: Resolved an issue where install fails on ARMv7 systems. Many thanks to @maschiw for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2959
- DietPi-Software | Node-RED: Resolved an issue where install fails due to missing data dir creation. Many thanks to @Orfait for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2975
- DietPi-Software | Node-RED: Resolved an issue where user creation fails if "gpio" group is not present. Many thanks to @marcobrianza for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2975#issuecomment-513917360
- DietPi-Software | OpenVPN: Resolved an issue where install failed on Debian Buster due to a new easy-rsa version with changed commands and options. Now the most recent easy-rsa is manually downloaded on all systems to generate server and client key + cert with modern methods and the client config is slightly updated to match modern settings.
- DietPi-Software | XRDP: On Stretch, new the version from backports is installed. This resolves a critical issue where /etc/profile was not loaded to the session and, due to incomplete $PATH variable, important system binaries were not available on terminal emulators which broke many install and upgrade tasks. Furthermore this resolves an issue where install and connection of XRDP failed if IPv6 was disabled. Many thanks to @aspinks for the debug session which allowed us to track the issue down to its root: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3017
- DietPi-Software | Sonarr: Resolved an issue where install failed due to an outdated APT repository key. Many thanks to @GregoryDosh and @GulyFMG for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3029
- DietPi-Software | Plex Media Server: Resolved an issue where DietPi-Update failed for versions prior to v6.23, due to the obsolete Plex Media Server dev2day repository being offline now. This repo is now removed via pre-patches, prior to G_AGUP being called. During regular patches PMS is reinstalled, applying the new official APT repo.

v6.25
(03/07/19)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- System | By default the "haveged" entropy daemon is now installed on all DietPi systems and patched with v6.25. It assures the pool of random bits /dev/random stays filled by using additional sources of randomness. This solves a bunch of issues, including hanging or very long boot times, very long service (re)starts or timeout failures and on Buster hanging network access. Especially affected is PHP7.3-FPM but as well VPN servers and WiFi hotspots and potentially many other network or cryptography related tasks. More information on this topic: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2806
- System | Initial RPi4 support has been added to the code and some other rare RPi models are now detected correctly by their revision codes. Note that a new Buster-based image is required to support RPi4 and further work on DietPi-Config to support new RPi4 features. Full support is expected with DietPi v6.26, testing images can be found here: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2935#issuecomment-506389899
- DietPi-FirstBoot | First boot setup steps have been moved into a separate script and systemd unit. This allows further cleanup of the regular boot process and more targeted debugging and development. Many thanks for @FredericGuilbault for implementing this enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2791
- DietPi-Autostart | When choosing an autostart option that does not require a manual UNIX user login, the autologin user can now be chosen (which was always "root" previously). This can be applied automatically on firstrun setup with the new "AUTO_SETUP_AUTOSTART_LOGIN_USER" setting within dietpi.txt. If the user does not exist, is a system user (UID < 1000) or does not have a valid login shell, it will be reverted to root. Many thanks to @FredericGuilbault for suggesting this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2926
- DietPi-Globals | G_OBTAIN_CPU_TEMP(): Added support for Core2Duo CPU temperature to be printed on e.g. DietPi-Banner and "cpu" command output. Many thanks to @OstrovCity for posting the required information: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2563#issuecomment-494388278
- DietPi-Service 2.0 | Combines dietpi-process_tool into dietpi-services. Adds I/O policies, single/global service control and much more: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2786
- DietPi-Process_tool | Has been replaced with DietPi-Services. Existing saved options will no longer be available, please use 'dietpi-services' to apply required process_tool options with the upgraded system.
- DietPi-Explorer | Disabled opening of files in nano under select a file/folder mode.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Added the option to change the I/O scheduler per drive. Many thanks to @Generator for pointing us onto this topic: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2233
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Services are not stopped directly at start of this script any more. Instead this is done only on critical tasks, e.g. transferring of DietPi userdata, the swapfile or RootFS. Further increased navigation speed by re-running the drive detection loop only when affecting changes have been made, and, by several other code enhancements.
- DietPi-Config | APT Cache: We added new options to "dietpi-config" > "Advanced Options" > "APT Cache" to disable the APT cache or move cache, repo lists and/or package download dir to RAM. By default we disable the APT cache, which saves 50 - 100 MiB disk writes on each "apt-get update" call, but slows down "apt-cache" calls: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2840
- DietPi-Config | RTC mode: When selecting this option, a menu with additional info is shown instead of just toggling the state. Many thanks to @Sopor for this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2826
- DietPi-Config | Audio Options (RPi): I-Sabre-K2M/Q2M sound card drivers are now integrated into the RPi kernel. These are now enabled on selection instead of compiling the drivers from source: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2690
- DietPi-Software | Mycroft AI FOSS voice assistant is now available for install. Many thanks to @LexiconCode for the initial request and all other requesters, FeatHub voters and testers: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1701
- DietPi-Software | Resolved some misleading outputs when having VNC Server or GPU using software installed. Many thanks to @mtpiercey for reporting these issues: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2870
- DietPi-Software | Deluge: Lowered UMask (007 => 002) to allow read access from e.g. custom Samba shares without "dietpi" user. Many thanks to @radsb for reporting the limited access: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=5847
- DietPi-Software | FFmpeg: On RPi, the new APT repo package will be installed, which now supports RPi hardware acceleration and is some subversion newer then the package hosted on dietpi.com: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/869#issuecomment-490047405
- DietPi-Software | Gitea: Current stable v1.8.X will be installed now and existing instances will be upgraded during DietPi-Update. Many thanks to @msongz for implementing this: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2881
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: Current upstream version will be installed now and existing instances will be upgraded during DietPi-Update, which requires a config file reset. A backup to recover custom settings from will be created: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2156#issuecomment-497513129
- DietPi-Software | O!MPD: Current upstream version will be installed now and existing instances will be upgraded during DietPi-Update. Existing config and database will be preserved. YouTube and Tidal support is added now by default. Many thanks to @ArturSierzant for giving valuable feedback and suggestions: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2884
- DietPi-Software | Ampache: Reinstalls will now preserve existing configs and database.
- DietPi-Software | Medusa: mediainfo is now installed to enable Medusa gathering meta data and resolving related warnings in log. Additionally, on Stretch and above, Python3 is now installed and used, as recommended by Medusa for a while. Many thanks to @bluesmoke for suggesting this enhancement: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=5945
- DietPi-Software | Node-RED: "sudo" permissions are now enabled by default: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2910

Bug Fixes:
- Network | Resolved an issue where an unintended Ethernet/WiFi IP value was shown if no IP is assigned.
- DietPi-Boot | Waiting for network timer now includes the start of 'ifup' for the device. This is to speed up boot time by threading the ifup command and allowing the wait timer to be more accurate.
- DietPi-Login | Resolved an issue where login leads to immediate logout if DietPi scripts were not loaded to DietPi-RAMdisk location. Many thanks to @LexiconCode for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2841#issuecomment-494567292
- DietPi-Update | Resolved an issue where after update and reboot DietPi-Banner still shows update available with identical current and server versions.
- DietPi-Cleaner | Resolved an issue where the cleaner ran into an endless loop if "Files" cleaner was used. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2837
- DietPi-PREP | Resolved an issue where ifupdown (networking service) was autoremoved, which broke running network connections.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where idle spin down selection would always default to 241, instead of currently active value: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2852
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where eCryptfs fstab entries were not detected and preserved correctly. Many thanks to @johnvick for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=18428#p18283
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where transferring the RootFS to a BTRFS formatted drive fails. Since BTRFS support is not natively built into the RPi and Odroid kernel, a warning prompts and the transfer is aborted. Many thanks to @dieitpi for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=18164#p18164
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where on x86_64 systems a specific Seagate drive, attached via USB, does not spin down on idle. Many thanks to @tomillr for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2905
- DietPi-Config | (RPi) Resolved an issue where selecting sound cards with vc4 enabled would result with incorrect ALSA card index: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2173
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where selecting any locale (language) failed, which does not contain "UTF-8" in its name. DietPi only supports UTF-8 locales, but those available with UTF-8 only, do not have the ".UTF-8" suffix in their name.
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue on Buster systems that were dist-upgraded manually from Stretch, where DietPi-Software failed to obtain the global software password. Many thanks to @MattL0 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2937
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where audio software failed to use hardware acceleration on Buster. Users need to be part of the new "render" group on Buster to have permissions. Many thanks to @tomillr for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2916
- DietPi-Software | MotionEye: Resolved an issue on ARMv6 where install failed due to PHP Buster repo conflicts. Many thanks to @infinitejones for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2888

v6.24.1
(18/05/19 Hotfix)

Bug Fixes:
- DietPi-WiFi-Monitor | Resolved an issue where the service leads to a constant high CPU load. Many thanks for @GulyFMG for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2802
- DietPi-Software | PHP: On ARMv6, fine tuned the required Buster branch priority pins to avoid certain APT dependency errors. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2808, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2811
- DietPi-Software | Lighttpd: Resolved an issue where Lighttpd fails to start on ARMv6. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2808

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.24
(15/05/19 Hotfix)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- DietPi-Software | Emby + Plex Server: Enabled access to DietPi network mounts and media files by default. Many thanks to @ilgrank for reporting this missing feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2801
- DietPi-Software | ownCloud + phpBB: Support had to be disabled on ARMv6 for now until we either find a way to install PHP7.2 (with all required modules) outside of sury.org (which does not support ARMv6) or those enable support for PHP7.3 (expected with ownCloud 10.3 and phpBB 3.3).

Bug Fixes:
- DietPi-Software | PHP: Resolved a critical issue where PHP install/update broke ARMv6 devices since Debian armhf does not support ARMv6 like Raspbian does. Many thanks for the fast user reports: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2794
- DietPi-Software | PHP: Resolved an issue where APT upgrade can fail due to insufficient sury.org APT repo preferences. Many thanks to @sifyer for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2795
- DietPi-WiFi-Monitor | Resolved a failure due to false concurrency check. Many thanks to @GulyFMG for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2802

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.23
(12/05/19)

Jessie support:
- The support for Debian Jessie is fading constantly by software titles and Debian itself, increasing the effort for us to work around the raising issues: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2332
- As a result we move Jessie systems to a dedicated "jessie-support" branch. Next DietPi v6.24 will still be merged into this branch as well, but for following updates it depends on how much additional related issues we face.
- We highly recommend to migrate to Stretch as fast as possible.
- Odroid C1: We have updated the image to Stretch based on ARMbian 4.18 kernel. Existing Jessie installations will be moved to the jessie-support branch: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2561

Buster support:
- DietPi-Software | Resolved the last failing installs on Debian Buster systems by either fixing or disabling them: phpMyAdmin and Tomcat8 are currently not available on non-RPi Buster systems.
- DietPi on Debian Buster x86_64 systems can be considered as compatible and stable now. On ARM devices some last software install tests are outstanding, especially on Raspberry Pi with Raspbian particularities. We will ship experimental images for testing purpose soon.

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- DietPi-Banner | Added support for DietPi message of the day (MOTD). This is enabled by default, however, can be disabled. Checks for latest MOTD once a day.
- DietPi-Banner | Always prints the local IP during boot mode display: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2681
- DietPi-Benchmark | Increased default survey RootFS and RAM benchmark sizes. 100MB (from 10MB) for RootFS. RAM is 1/4 of available. This is ensure a more accurate calculation of throughput when we divide bytes against time, to obtain the MB/s result. Benchmarks now also run at Nice -19 and realtime I/O with priority 0 (highest).
- DietPi-Cleaner | Added a confirmation prompt, before removal of offline docs and man pages, as this may cause APT issues in some circumstances. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2751
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | When applying to Lighttpd, "webroot" authentication is now used instead of "standalone". This allows the auto-renewal service to succeed while Lighttpd is running. Many thanks to @minnux for testing this method: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2680#issuecomment-480095449
- DietPi-Arr_to_RAM | With v6.18 we silently added a new script (for Stretch and above) that allows linking Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr database files to RAM, increasing access performance, reducing disk I/O and avoiding constant external HDD spinning due to the very regular access to these files. This script has gone through some rework and polishing and can now be enabled to automatically link those databases to RAM on boot and store them back to disk on shutdown. For more details read: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=5828. Many thanks to @Dr0bac for providing valuable input and testing the development progress constantly: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2689
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | eCryptfs and vboxsf (VirtualBox shared folder) fstab entries are now preserved. Many thanks to @johnvick and @Phil1988 for suggesting: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2078, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2202
- DietPi-PREP | The script execution can now be fully automated via environment variables. Many thanks to @FredericGuilbault for adding this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2756
- DietPi-Config | Added support to toggle Intel CPU turbo/boost mode. Requires Intel CPU that supports the feature.
- DietPi-Config | G_CHECK_URL: Added ability to change the connection attempts and timeout, before DietPi URL checking assumes a dead link and failure: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2717
- DietPi-Config | Serial/UART device handling has been reworked. Serial login consoles can now be toggled for every found serial device individually. On RPi the primary UART can be completely disabled and warnings are prompted if Bluetooth and login console are to be enabled both on ttyAMA0. On update existing systems will be patched so that serial-getty masks and enabled instances are removed if the related serial device does not exist. This solves some error messages during boot.
- DietPi-Config | Network Adapter menu has been cleaned up. Proxy variables are now sourced from "/etc/bashrc.d/dietpi-proxy.sh" and proxy setup outside of DietPi scripts is detected.
- DietPi-NordVPN | Added ability to toggle auto start/connect during boot.
- DietPi-Software | Subsonic: Package has been updated to v6.1.5. Many thanks to @spectrumcomputing: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2702
- DietPi-Software | PHP: All systems will be upgraded to PHP7.3 for security, performance, compatibility and consistency across distro versions. Ondrejs (official Debian PHP maintainer) PHP repository (sury.org) is used for this on Jessie and Stretch, so general functionality and trustworthiness is assured. ownCloud and phpBB users will stay on PHP7.2 for where PHP7.3 is not yet supported. Your PHP configurations will be backed up and webserver configurations adjusted to match the new version. Nextcloud 13 and earlier, especially Jessie systems, will be upgraded to Nextcloud 14 to allow PHP7.3. A full Nextcloud backup will be done, your data, settings and custom apps will be preserved. We strongly advice to further upgrade to the current Nextcloud major version via its web UI updater.
- DietPi-Software | Subsonic: Runs now as limited user "subsonic". This change is as well applied to existing installs via patch during DietPi-Update: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2705
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard APT packages are now upgraded when running "apt-get upgrade". Many thanks to @swrobel for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2671
- DietPi-Software | LXQt, GIMP, XFCE4 Power manager: Now available for installations.
- DietPi-Software | Plex Media Server: All systems are migrated to the new official APT repository. This allows easy and consistent upgrades via APT. On ARM systems the until now used 3rd party dev2day repo receives no further updates and will be shut down soon, which makes the migration mandatory. Many thanks to @WolfganP for keeping us informed with news about Plex v1.15 and the new APT repo: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2655
- DietPi-Software | Logitech Media Server: Now installs the latest nightly version, since no public "releases" are done. As well the systemd service has gone through some update and now runs as limited user to align with other media servers, enhance security and follow the defaults of the DPKG package. The update/change is applied to existing installs via DietPi-Update as well. Your settings/date are preserved.
- DietPi-Software | Nextcloud Talk: We do not apply (D)TLS settings to coTURN any more. Since WebRTC is encrypted by itself there is no security benefit. More importantly Nextcloud Talk does not make use of the required TURNS protocol, so there is absolutely no point to apply these settings. The (D)TLS feature is meant to allow passing firewalls that only allow encrypted traffic. WebRTC, although encrypted, might not pass such firewalls since the encryption is not on transport layer. For those how are interested in further details and discussion: https://github.com/coturn/coturn/issues/33, https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/issues/257
- DietPi-Software | SABnzbd: Install latest version via GitHub master and skip adjusting existing config file. systemd unit and dependencies have been adjusted to match minimum requirements and official documentation. The update will be applied via DietPi v6.23 patch as well. Many thanks to @19eighties for reporting the outdated version: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2762
- DietPi-Software | Jackett: On non-ARMv6 devices the new (v0.11+) standalone (non-mono) binary is installed now. This is applied on DietPi-Update as well, preserving your settings: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2773
- DietPi-Software | Blynk: Enabled support for Debian Buster by using the new Java 11 binary.
- DietPi-Software | UrBackup: New version 2.3.8 is installed now. Many thanks to @DeathIsUnknown for informing us about the update: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2783

Bug Fixes:
- System | Debian has vastly reduced support for Jessie systems from their official APT repository. The limited possible list entries are applied during DietPi-Update. Many thanks to @BerndKohl for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2665
- DietPi-Set_swapfile | Resolved an issue where on first boot (and when calling the script manually) the swapfile creation is attempted on target file systems that do not support it (BTRFS). Many thanks to @mzramna for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/719#issuecomment-484205696
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where proxy settings would not be correct after a reboot. Many thanks to @stephantual for reporting this!: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2704
- DietPi-Update | Resolved an issue where on older images first run update didn't finalise as intended, leading to several first run setup issues, depending on the image age. The fix has been applied outside of the releases since only the online part of the updater is affected: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2684
- DietPi-Login | Resolved an issue where login as non-root user could result in a "sudo" password prompt or endless failure loop due to missing sudo permissions. Many thanks to @xsak for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2667
- DietPi-Software | Emby Server: Resolved an issue where download failed if the latest release does not contain a Debian package. Many thanks to @niblettr for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=5755
- DietPi-Software | Transmission: Resolved an issue where double quotes in global software password caused a service startup failure. Many thanks to @Drew80 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2484#issuecomment-480675168
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard: Resolved an issue where IPv6 connections did not work with enabled IPv6 forwarding. Many thanks to @schnuckz for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2691
- DietPi-Software | Subsonic: Resolved an issue where FFmpeg transcoder might not have been applied correctly. Many thanks to @spectrumcomputing for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2697
- DietPi-Software | AmiBerry: Resolved an issue where no login prompt was present when exiting AmiBerry from fastboot mode. Many thanks to @Trigger58 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2703#issuecomment-482471440
- DietPi-Software | Logitech Media Server: Resolved an issue where certain plugins failed due to missing "libio-socket-ssl-perl". Many thanks to @noobian and @Edward for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=5824
- DietPi-Software | Fail2Ban: Resolved an issue where the service silently failed due to wrong log level settings on Stretch and Buster systems. Many thanks to @joaofl for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/90#issuecomment-485140236
- DietPi-Software | Redis: Resolved an issue on Jessie systems where the service fails to start due to wrong shipped permissions from Debian package: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2736
- DietPi-Software | Nextcloud: Resolved an issue on Lighttpd with HTTPS enabled where OPcache settings were not applied as desired, leading to a warning on Nextcloud admin panel. Many thanks to @Borotes for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2489
- DietPi-Software | Nextcloud/ownCloud: Fixed a wrong directive in our Lighttpd configs. Many thanks to @WilburWalsh for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2775
- DietPi-Software | Nextcloud Talk: Resolved an issue where coTURN prints two warnings about deprecated settings on Buster systems, due to some changes with latest versions.
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: Resolved an issue on RPi where Kodi (v18) fails to start when a custom screen resolution was chosen. Many thanks to @johnnypea for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=17550#p17550
- DietPi-Software | Java: Resolved an issue where install fails on Jessie systems since the used jessie-backports APT repo does not exist any more: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2752
- DietPi-Software | Java: Resolved an issue where install fails on Buster systems since OpenJDK 8 packages are not available any more on Buster repo. OpenJDK 11 is installed instead, testing with Java software titles is outstanding.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.22
(23/03/19)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- Security | The DietPi-Software global password is now stored with enhanced security which also resolves a warning on Buster systems: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2213
- System | /etc/bashrc.d/ now allows ".bash" file ending as well. We merged all contained DietPi scripts into one (/etc/bashrc.d/dietpi.bash): https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2636
- General | DietPi scripts now use the lightweight standalone "7zr" command to handle 7z archives. This allows us to lower the DietPi core package dependency from "p7zip-full" to "p7zip".
- RPi | DietPi does not set or change "framebuffer_depth" in config.txt any more which defaults to 16 which works in every known case. It will be re-added as fast as we find a case where another value is required.

- DietPi-NordVPN | Added sent/received usage stats for VPN tunnel.
- DietPi-Sync | Sync will now abort if the source directory is empty. Merged dry run into real sync, as this was performed anyway to do required free space check. When "Sync" is selected, after dry run the user is presented a summary and given the option to view the detailed dry run log, cancel or continue with real sync. Some other minor fixes and enhancements have been applied as well. Many thanks to @midnightwatcher for doing this request: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=5588

Deluge now runs as user "debian-deluged", logs have been moved to "/var/log/deluged/" and the init.d service with its traces are removed, which are all pre-generated by the Debian APT package. The systemd units have been adjusted according to the official Deluge documentation. These changes are applied as well to existing installs during DietPi update, the old user "deluge" and obsolete configurations are removed. Your active configurations and data are preserved, the installer has been as well enhanced to better handle existing installs and never touch existing configs. Note that access to the Deluge console has to be done as user "debian-deluged" (sudo -u debian-deluged deluge-console). A related access issue to the console has been fixed by this as well.

v6.20
(28/01/19)

Image line-up:
- We removed Jessie images from our download server (besides for Odroid C1), since we see no advantage to use them anymore. Existing Jessie systems are still supported, but we encourage all users to consider switching to a fresh Stretch image by times: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2332

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- DietPi-PREP | Removed the option to install a Jessie system. Removed the option to install DietPi on top of a Wheezy image, since an upgrade over two distro version would be required, which is not reliable. It is still possible to install DietPi on top of a Jessie image, where a distro upgrade to Stretch would be applied: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2332
- General | RPi-Update: In our effort to improve system stability, and, offer software installations which build custom modules (e.g. WireGuard), we can not longer support systems with non-stock APT kernel installed. If "rpi-update" is installed during update, DietPi will prompt and return you back to stock APT kernel.
- General | Moved the remaining conf/* files located on DietPi-RAMdisk to /var/lib/dietpi or into DietPi-PREP, and removed /DietPi/dietpi/conf completely. These files were only used once or never, thus have no business inside the RAMdisk.
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Improved available options for HDMI boost setting: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2350
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Headless display mode is now applied via undocumented config.txt setting. Removed/Replaced some other obsolete config.txt entries: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2402

- DietPi-Config | WiFi Hotspot: You can now toggle support for 802.11 N. Please note this is device and compatibility dependent, mileage may vary.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Now allows to check & repair the boot file system and trigger it for root file system on next reboot: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1740#issuecomment-388325204
- DietPi-Software | AmiBerry: Updated to v2.24, thanks @midwan! Brings several bug fixes, new features and improvements over the previous version (2.19). Please check the version history for full details on the changes made: https://github.com/midwan/amiberry/wiki/Version-history
- DietPi-Software | DietPi-NordVPN: Now available for installation. Includes a GUI which allows for easy connection to a list of NordVPN servers 'dietpi-nordvpn'. If you need a NordVPN subscription, please use this link: https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=5305&url_id=902
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard VPN is now available for installation. Is can be easily configured as client or as server, passing either all client traffic through the tunnel, local network access only, or server access only, e.g. as well in combination with Pi-hole, to have remote ad blocking.

- DietPi-Software | ownCloud/Nextcloud: Updated webserver configs to match current recommendations and security hardenings. Only applied on new installs. To apply manually, run "dietpi-software reinstall 47" (ownCloud) or "dietpi-software reinstall 114" (Nextcloud). You will be informed about the new configs, which then need to be manually moved to overwrite the old ones, since we don't want to mess with manual changes: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2361
- DietPi-Software | OpenSSH: Host keys won't be recreated anymore on reinstall, only on first boot of a fresh image, using now "dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server" to generate default key types based on distro.

- DietPi-Update | Added optional ability to automatically update DietPi, when updates are available. Please note, this is disabled by default.

- DietPi-RAMlog/Logclear | The internally rotated LetsEncrypt (CertBot) log files are now removed, hourly with DietPi-RAMlog enabled, or when executing DietPi-Logclear manually.

Bug Fixes:
- DietPi-Software | LXDE: Installation will no longer enable the weather application. This is due to Yahoo API hard coded into LXpanel, being taken offline: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2416#issuecomment-456805925

DietPi-Cron | /etc/cron.minutely/ is now disabled by default, to reduce cron executions and logs. This is also patched with v6.13, if no script is placed within the folder. Use "dietpi-cron" to enable and configure this feature.
General | All DietPi scripts by default now use /tmp RAMFS to create, download and handle temporary files. By this we speed up especially installations and reduce disk I/O: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1801
General | By default systemd-logind is now masked on DietPi images. This can be changed by setting AUTO_UNMASK_LOGIND=1 within dietpi.txt. As well it will be unmasked automatically, if libpam-systemd was installed during dietpi-software installation: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1767
General | "fake-hwclock" is purged now on first run setup and v6.13 patch, if a real hardware clock is available.
Image | NanoPC-T4: Image updated which now includes custom kernel/modules created by @carlosedp. Adds CIFS, docker support and much more. Please note, WiFi scan is intermittent with this kernel, and, may take a few attempts to be successful, however, we believe the additional modules are a higher priority: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1829
Image | RPi: New RPi images will be shipped without "initramfs-tools" preinstalled. The RPi bootloader does no require it and there are alternatives, e.g. "rpi-initramfs-tools" and "tiny-initramfs". The package can be manually purged on RPi systems, but "kmod" and "udev" need to be marked als manually installed first, so they will never be removed: "apt-mark manual kmod udev && apt-mark auto initramfs-tools && G_AGA"

Important Information:
All DietPi images have been re-created. Existing installations (v159 or lower), can no longer be updated, or supported. To continue support, users must install the latest v6.0 image.
 - https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1385
 - All images are now Debian Stretch (excluding Odroid's)
 - ARMbian based images are now mainline kernel 4.13+.
 - Native PC (EFI): is now an ISO, with clonezilla bundled. Simplifies installation via Rufus write: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1171#issuecomment-336522021

Minor notes:
The XMAS tree has now been taken down, stored away on github history for next year. Hope you all had a good one :D
